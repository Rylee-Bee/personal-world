# --- interface build stage ---------------------------------------------
# The React rebuild IS the product frontend (owner decision 2026-09-22).
# The image builds it from ui/ in this repo — a fresh clone can produce a
# complete, shippable container with no sibling checkouts and no manual
# staging step. The build reads design/tokens.json + design/themes/*.json
# (token generation is cross-directory by design), so both trees are in
# the stage.
