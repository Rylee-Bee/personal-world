# Kilo Onboarding — Project Worlds

This is a fast orientation layer for any Kilo session landing on
Project Worlds. It is NOT a contract. It is the next agent's first
60 seconds.

## Who am I?

> You are operating through **Kilo** — an agent harness / CLI+TUI
> (opencode fork). Your brain/model may vary per session. Capability and
> authorization are NOT the same thing: Kilo exposes tools; the project
> authorizes their use.

The Kilo harness layer is profiled at `.project/participants/kilo/`.
The currently-loaded brain's profile (if any) lives at
`.project/participants/<brain-id>/`.

## Where am I?

- **Product name:** Project Worlds (renamed from "Personal World"
  2026-09-12 — product identity only).
- **Repository slug:** `Rylee-Bee/personal-world` (unchanged).
- **Working directory:** this repo's root.
- **Canonical current state:** `.project/CURRENT.md`.
- **Trunk:** `main` (one canonical trunk; the 2026-09-12 trunk-unification
  pass is complete).

## What do I read first?

In this order, stop when you have enough to act:

0. **Establish canonical freshness** — on-disk state is evidence of
   what is present, not proof of what is current. Before trusting any
   `.project/CURRENT.md` content as authoritative, run:

   ```bash
   git status --short
   git fetch origin
   git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/main
   git rev-parse origin/main
   ```

   If the local checkout is behind, fast-forward with
   `git pull --ff-only origin main` (do NOT merge or rebase without
   owner confirmation). Record the SHA you actually work against.
   **Repo freshness and Play-Nice adoption freshness are separate
   questions.** The repo should generally use current canonical project
   truth when safe; the adoption pin is whatever the project
   explicitly adopted and stays pinned unless the owner asks for a
   bump.

1. This file (you're reading it).
2. `.project/README.md` — the three-layer model (Play-Nice contracts →
   project context → participant packs).
3. `.project/CURRENT.md` — current product state.
4. `.project/contracts/adoption.yaml` — what is adopted at which
   revision. **Do not change the pin** unless the owner explicitly
   asks and you have verified the upstream commit + lockfile.
5. `.project/participants/README.md` — current pack table.
6. Only the task-relevant participant pack(s). Don't bulk-read all
   packs if the task doesn't touch them.
7. `AGENTS.md` and the project's `AGENT_CONTRACTS.md` for top-level
   operating rules.
8. Memory layer:
   - `memory_journal_check` if you suspect a prior failed attempt.
   - `memory_memory_search` if the task recurs across sessions.
   - `preferences_get_profile` for owner preferences not in the
     always-loaded files.

## What can Kilo do?

See `.project/participants/kilo/capabilities.yaml`. Short version:

- Read, search, edit, write files in the worktree.
- Run shell commands (read-only freely; mutating git commands prompt
  per command; confirmation cannot be saved as always-allow).
- Web fetch + search + several MCPs (memory, preferences, synology,
  proxmox, unifi, dns-traefik, gitea read-side, firecrawl, reddit,
  context7, figma, kilo-local-recall, inbox).
- Compose tool calls in structured form (tables, code fences,
  question tool, plan tool).
- NOT push, NOT merge, NOT deploy, NOT bypass confirmation, NOT
  rewrite another participant's pack without consent.

## What can the current brain do?

Read `.project/participants/<brain-id>/participant.yaml`. Do not
duplicate the brain's capability claims here — that file is the
authoritative source. If no brain pack exists, the brain is
unprofiled; record its capabilities via observation only, not
fabrication.

## Where does authority come from?

Order of authority (highest wins):

1. Live runtime state and what is actually on disk.
2. Source code / repo-tracked configuration.
3. Tests and validation (`uv run pytest`, `framework validate`).
4. Git history.
5. `.project/CURRENT.md` and the project canonical contracts.
6. `.agent/STATE.md` / `.agent/HANDOFF.md` (overwrite, keep concise).
7. `.agent/decisions/` (durable decisions).
8. Project `AGENTS.md` + `AGENT_CONTRACTS.md`.
9. Participant packs (enrichment, never canonical unless the project
   explicitly promotes information from them).
10. Semantic memory / lore (evidence about the past, never authoritative
    about present state).

**Authority is NOT:**

- The presence of a tool in the harness.
- A model reputation claim.
- A previous session's narrative summary.
- The brain's self-rating.

## When do I ask for help?

Use the `question` tool with 2-3 options (recommended option first)
when:

- Scope is ambiguous or the task could expand.
- Two valid architectures both work and the trade-off matters.
- Authority is unclear (especially across participant packs).
- You'd otherwise invent a value to complete a tidy summary.
- The work would mutate a file marked protected or owned by another
  participant.
- A destructive or hard-to-reverse operation is on the table.
- The owner said "ask before fixing" (set 2026-08-15).
- Multiple sources disagree and you can't reconcile them with
  available tools.

Default: when in doubt, ask. The cost of an unnecessary question is
one tap; the cost of a wrong guess is an entire redo.

## How do I finish?

Every consequential session ends with:

- **Verification:** the exact command + observed output for every
  claim about state, counts, sizes, or test results. No naked "30/30
  green" — paste the command.
- **Evidence:** file:line where the change lives, and the diff
  summary.
- **Exact changed state:** which files were touched, which were not,
  and what was deliberately left dirty.
- **UNKNOWNs:** anything you couldn't verify, named explicitly.
- **Next action:** the single next concrete step, not "continue."
- **Clean handoff:** if ending mid-investigation, write
  `.agent/HANDOFF.md` with confirmed facts, eliminated hypotheses,
  current hypotheses, and unresolved questions.
- **No inventions:** "I have not verified this" is a valid answer.
- **No recap of the user's words back at them.**

## Dogfood note (2026-09-12)

This onboarding packet was created as part of a Play-Nice experiment
requested from the MiniMax-m3 brain running in Kilo. What that
session observed:

- **Canonical-freshness check before any writing:** turn 1 caught a
  21-commit local-vs-remote drift; turn 2 caught a fresh 1-commit
  drift. Both times the project fast-forwarded with `git pull
  --ff-only` before any participant-pack authoring. The Play-Nice
  adoption pin (v0.6.0 @ `21b6841a`) was honored unchanged through
  both updates — repo freshness and contract freshness are treated as
  separate questions.
- **Efficient project-truth discovery:** read 7 files
  (`CURRENT.md`, `project.yaml`, `adoption.yaml`, two participant
  packs, `participants/README.md`, `AGENTS.md`) — no `contractctl`
  available, no blind re-read of all 65 contracts.
- **Sibling participant preservation (not "general protected-WIP
  detection"):** an existing `big-pickle/` pack was discovered; the
  decision to leave it untouched and author a separate `minimax/`
  pack alongside it was made via a clarifying question with 3
  options, not a silent rewrite. The `big-pickle/` pack remained
  byte-identical to HEAD throughout. Generalizing this to "MiniMax
  detects protected WIP" would overstate the evidence — what was
  observed is narrower.
- **Harness/brain separation:** two distinct packs
  (`.project/participants/kilo/` for the harness, `.project/
  participants/minimax/` for the brain) with explicit
  `not_authoritative_for` boundaries and cross-references.
- **Self-validation caught a real failure mode:** the first draft
  placed markdown-table content inside files named `.yaml`. A
  deterministic `yaml.safe_load()` parse failed, the files were
  repaired into schema-conformant structured YAML before any
  commit. Lesson: parse generated structured files before accepting
  them, do NOT trust readable output as structurally valid.

## Anti-patterns observed in this project (do not repeat)

- `git add -A` in a shared checkout — sweeps in unrelated WIP.
- Bumping the adoption pin without verifying upstream via the live
  GitHub API.
- Fabricating test counts in summaries (the 2026-08-17 incident
  taught this lesson; see project history).
- Treating a participant pack as canonical project truth.
