# Project Worlds — Durable Decisions

Decisions that are RESOLVED and durable — the "why it is this way"
record. Current implementation state lives in
[`.project/CURRENT.md`](./CURRENT.md); the cooperation constitution
lives in [`contracts/adoption.yaml`](./contracts/adoption.yaml)
(Play-Nice Contracts, upstream at
[github.com/Rylee-Bee/play-nice-contracts](https://github.com/Rylee-Bee/play-nice-contracts)).

Each entry records the decision, the date, and the standing reason.
Nothing here is silently reopened; changing a decision means a new
dated entry superseding the old one (append-only, like the journal).

## Product identity

- **2026-09-06 — Capabilities are core-owned; providers are optional
  implementations or enrichments.** (ADR-0001) The core must survive
  the disappearance of every optional integration; enforced by
  `personal-world framework validate` and `tests/test_framework.py`.
  Reason: a personal control plane must never become a disguised
  dependency on one external system.

- **2026-09-13 — "The world knows how loudly to exist" is an
  implementation/design principle, not copywriting.** Workshop v3
  (file `Wbg1rdt9fVCjWAXEKI1pTc`, philosophy artifact 17:8873,
  convergence audit 18:2) is the current implementation design
  authority for all 16 canonical frames, and its emotional-volume
  system (GENEROUS → AMBIENT → PRACTICAL → ATTENTIVE → QUIET) governs
  how loudly any surface may speak. Screens must be evaluated for
  what is visually loudest and whether importance reads as urgency —
  recorded per frame as AUTOMATED/AGENT REVIEW vs OWNER EXPERIENCE,
  never collapsed into one claim. Reason: the convergence process
  (Rylee described the converged design as more magical than she had
  imagined; the audit's register lines) produced volume rules that
  are the design's substance, and tonight's first implementation
  proved they are enforceable in code, not just prose.

- **2026-09-13 — The design-to-code guardrail held, and that outcome
  is the precedent.** The first unattended implementation attempt
  produced zero code because Figma evidence was unavailable. Rather
  than weakening the guardrail, the project established the full
  chain: Figma evidence (both `get_design_context` and
  `get_screenshot` from the desktop Dev Mode MCP server) → repository
  authority (`.project/design/CURRENT.md` + `WORKSHOP-V3-MANIFEST.yaml`)
  → MCP bridge (SSH reverse tunnel, no credentials in tracked files)
  → implementation skill (`personal-world-implement-figma`) → visual
  comparison → D0–D4 report. With the chain in place, the first
  implementation (Today — Quiet Day, `1a1e6ef`) completed in one
  session because ambiguity had been removed in advance. Reason:
  evidence-first made honesty cheaper than fabrication; keep the
  chain mandatory.

- **2026-09-12 — The product is "Project Worlds"; the companion
  character keeps the name "Personal World."** "Project Worlds is the
  environment; Personal World is the companion inside it." Technical
  identifiers intentionally stay `personal-world` (repo slug,
  `personal_world` package, `personal-world` CLI, compose services,
  schema URIs); historical references are preserved rather than
  rewritten. Reason: continuity of tooling and truthful history.

## Milestones

- **2026-09-13 — Workshop v3 implementation milestone: the bridge works.** Today — Quiet Day (Figma node `17:481`) became the first canonical Workshop v3 frame implemented in the working product at commit `1a1e6ef`. This does **not** mark the Workshop v3 rollout complete: design convergence is 16/16, while implementation is 1/16. It establishes that the full design-to-product path works end-to-end: approved Figma design → repository design authority → Figma MCP → `personal-world-implement-figma` → canonical repository components/assets → rendered comparison → D0–D4 acceptance. The first unattended attempt correctly produced zero code when canonical evidence was unavailable; the project fixed the evidence chain rather than weakening the guardrail. Once that evidence existed, the implementation completed quickly while preserving truthful data, accessibility, repository behavior, and explicit reservations where design and implementation authority differed. Engineering acceptance reached D0–D3 PASS; D4 remained intentionally pending owner review. This is the point where Workshop v3 stopped being only a design language and became part of the working world. **The world knows how loudly to exist.**

## Source of truth

- **2026-09-12 — Project Worlds does not compute repository
  publication state itself. It consumes the read-only agent-sync
  project-state interface.** `agent-sync status --all --format json`
  (the pickle project's adapter layer, schema
  `play-nice/repo-status-v1`) is the single authoritative interpreter
  of Rylee's project estate: Git owns Git truth; agent-sync computes
  publication/safe-to-leave/work-state from it; Project Worlds'
  `AgentSyncProjectSensor` only invokes, parses, and normalizes that
  observation (unknown preserved, closed vocabularies enforced,
  exit-1 treated as a valid work-to-do signal); Projects presents,
  Today summarizes, Personal World explains. No second Git-state
  implementation exists inside Project Worlds, and an agent-sync bug
  is recorded + deferred to pickle, never worked around by
  duplicating Git logic. Reason: one computation, one authority —
  drift between tools showing "project state" is a truth failure
  no UI can repair.

- **2026-09-12 — Personal World may understand project state without
  gaining repository mutation authority.** The chat context carries a
  bounded read-only projection of the agent-sync observation; the
  assistant may summarize, explain, compare, and point to Projects.
  It may NOT push, commit, reset, rebase, stash, or clean, and no
  conversational phrasing is interpreted as Git authorization. The
  projects slice added understanding only, not capability; mutation-
  oriented proposal objects are out of scope until a real,
  owner-authorized Projects mutation workflow exists to prepare into.
  Reason: helpful understanding and dangerous reach must be built as
  separate layers — the seam stays closed until it can open with
  provenance.

- **2026-09-12 — Project-state truth and project-state freshness are
  separate dimensions.** WHAT agent-sync observed (publish_state,
  safe_to_leave, tree counts) and WHEN it observed it
  (`observed_at`, rendered as age) never collapse into each other:
  a stale observation of "diverged" is still a diverged observation,
  just not current evidence — staleness never converts state to
  unknown, and state never hides age. The stale marker is calm
  provenance ("may be stale"), never error vocabulary. Reason: old
  evidence is not false evidence, but it must never impersonate
  current evidence — and confusing the two dimensions would lie in
  both directions at once.

- **2026-09-12 — Project Worlds preserves the observation timestamp
  from agent-sync instead of presenting cached/previous observations
  as timeless current truth.** agent-sync's own `observed_at` is the
  only freshness source (no second clock, no freshness database, no
  polling); age is DERIVED at render time (backend
  `agent_sync.freshness()`, ONE frontend helper
  `lib/observation-age.ts`), the staleness threshold reuses the
  product-wide lab_state 30-minute `FRESHNESS` convention
  (asserted by test; no settings surface), and missing/invalid
  timestamps render as honestly unknown rather than fabricating an
  age. Every project-status surface (Projects glance + guts, Today,
  the assistant context) shows WHEN the estate was observed so the
  user never mistakes an old observation for current truth. Reason:
  truth has a timestamp; the UI must carry it, not invent it.

- **2026-09-15 — One Play Nice adoption manifest, at the project-context
  path, re-pinned to the library HEAD at adoption time.** The project had
  two adoption manifests with different pins
  (`.project/contracts/adoption.yaml` v0.6.0 @ `0cee065` vs a root
  `.contracts/adoption.yaml` @ `1c05de4`), and nothing machine-read
  either. Resolved to `.project/contracts/adoption.yaml` — the layout the
  Play-Nice project-context framework itself uses, the path declared by
  `.project/project.yaml`, and the path the session workflow resolves
  against; the duplicate was deleted and every document points at the one
  manifest. The same pass re-pinned v0.6.0 → **v0.7.0** @ `f825ffb`
  (library HEAD at adoption; adds the always-applicable `assume-unknown`
  contract) and re-attested with the real `contractctl` tool:
  `adopt` = ADOPTION VALID, `commit` = CONTRACT COMMITMENT ACTIVE. Reason:
  one authority per subject — a second manifest with a different pin is
  drift no reader can reconcile, and a pin that lags the library silently
  understates the floors the project claims to implement.


## Container distribution

- **2026-09-12 — Project Worlds is distributed as a versioned OCI
  image through GitHub Container Registry.** The portable Compose
  deployment consumes the published image; machine-specific
  integrations live in optional overrides. Tags: `:latest`
  (mutable convenience, refreshed on each successful main publish)
  and `:sha-<full SHA>` (immutable; documented rollback handle).
  Workflow `.github/workflows/publish-image.yml` triggers via
  `workflow_run` after `validate` passes on `main`; it uses
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `packages: write` + `contents: read`, no PAT.
  Compose layout: `compose.yaml` is the portable base (image-only,
  no host paths); `compose.dev.yaml` adds `build: .` for local
  development; `compose.homelab.yaml` carries the optional Rylee-only
  enrichment (Lab CLI + Kilo auth file) that previously lived in the
  base file. Rollback by pinning `PW_IMAGE` to a known-good
  `:sha-...` tag. Reason: a single CI build produces an appliance
  that boots on any Docker/Podman host with only a token and a data
  volume; the previous recipe required cloning the source tree and
  binding WSL-only host paths, both of which made the appliance
  non-portable in practice despite its header.

- **2026-09-12 — The published image is `linux/amd64` only.** The
  single host that currently runs Project Worlds is amd64; ARM is not
  in scope. Multi-arch would roughly double CI build cost and time
  without a real consumer. Revisit when an ARM deployment target
  appears. Reason: cheapest path that still meets the actual use;
  Play-Nice `dependency-discipline` and `search-before-inventing`
  forbid speculating complexity.

- **2026-09-12 — The GHCR package is public.** The image carries
  source only — no secrets, no private endpoints, no deployment
  topology (verified preflight against `SECURITY.md` and
  `tests/test_public_safety.py`). Discoverability is a feature, not a
  boundary. Reversible from the GHCR web UI at any time. Reason:
  no security boundary is crossed by publishing the source image
  publicly; private visibility would add an access-handling layer
  for no defensive gain.

## UAT data discipline

- **2026-09-12 — No persisted user data in the test environment until
  the owner calls the product at least beta.** Standing rule (owner
  directive during UAT, task `project-worlds-test-environment` and
  successors): the isolated `project-worlds-test` deployment must not
  accumulate real/persistent personal data. Every UAT walk starts
  from a verified clean slate (`podman compose -p
  project-worlds-test down -v` then `up -d`, with `GET /healthz`
  showing `setup_needed:true` as the proof, printed to the owner).
  Persistence in the test instance is only allowed for a specific,
  named test use case that requires surviving state (e.g. verifying
  restart persistence), and the volume is wiped again immediately
  after that check. Fixture/synthetic data only — `pw-safety`
  discipline applies. Real data waits for a deployment the owner
  has explicitly designated as persistent, which does not exist yet.
  Reason: during UAT the person must never wonder whether what they
  see is leftover state; a confusing slate is a trust failure, and
  Rylee's real data is too valuable to rest in a system whose
  persistence and auth seams are still being walked.

## Workbench & Node direction — the primary-viewport limb (owner update)

- **2026-09-21 — "Worlds as primary viewport" is a named lighthouse on the single Road-to-1.0; the
  Workbench/Node/Agent work is a limb over the existing homelab estate, not a second infrastructure
  platform.** Owner decisions D21–D24 (human, all-hands #7, `STAFF-MEETING-7-ALL-HANDS-REAL-WORLD-2026-09-21.md`):
  - **D21 (merge):** one canonical direction. The studio `ROADMAP.md` (Road-to-1.0) is the single roadmap;
    "Worlds as primary viewport" is a lighthouse on it. The architecture handoff, the owner-direction
    update, and `WORLDS-DIRECTION-ALIGNMENT-2026-09-21.md` are **folded into** this entry + ADR-0003…0007 +
    the roadmap lighthouse. Staff-meeting and handoff minutes remain **historical records**, not live
    sources of direction.
  - **D22 (flip-first):** the next real implementation proof is the **Station rebuild flip** (foundation).
    ADR/rule alignment proceeds **review-only in parallel**; the Workbench *build* starts after the flip
    lands. The thin slice = attach the existing `ai-distrobox` → Terminal → task/build → streaming →
    preview → artifacts, plus **one** genuine host capability, all on one event envelope.
  - **D23 (consolidate):** canonical direction lives in `ROADMAP.md` + `docs/PERSONAL-WORLD-FINISH-LINE.md`
    + `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` + `docs/adr/` + this file. Strategy docs are records.
  - **D24 (NetBird, with owner clarification):** NetBird is the **preferred leading prototype** for the
    eventual Node networking layer — **not** a dependency of the first thin slice. Preserved architecture:
    `Worlds Node` = one user-facing install (Worlds Agent + NetBird client as separate cooperating
    components); NetBird = mesh/routing/DNS/relay; Worlds Agent = identity/capabilities/orchestration/
    host-controls/task-events/desktop-brokerage/step-up; Worlds owns a generic `NetworkOverlay` contract
    (never coupled to NetBird's data model); NetBird replaceable; **no core capability on an
    Enterprise/paid-only feature.** Pin the Community/Enterprise + API split before ADR-0005 is accepted.
  - **Governing emphasis (owner, verbatim intent):** *the Workbench is not secondary to the Node/Agent
    work; Worlds is the place I work directly, other machines are attached resources; the Agent/network
    layer extends that environment and must not turn Worlds into an RMM.*
  Reason: the direction had sprawled across parallel documents; this entry + the ADRs are the one canonical
  record so future work grows toward it instead of fighting it. Rationale and detail: ADR-0003 (Workbench
  capability), ADR-0004 (Node/Agent), ADR-0005 (NetworkOverlay/NetBird), ADR-0006 (event envelope),
  ADR-0007 (Vault→OpenBao).

## Product language & interaction contract — owner-approved

- **2026-09-21 — The first-release product language and interaction contract is approved (human, owner
  round table).** Canonical home: [`docs/PRODUCT-LANGUAGE.md`](../docs/PRODUCT-LANGUAGE.md). It refines the
  finish line's older section vocabulary for the first release: **Today → Overview** (the front-page /
  headlines surface, not a competing section) · **Journal/Notes → Memory** (a deterministic place with
  recognizable, assignable icon+word categories, usable with every model off). **Records** (structured user
  information inside Memory; sensitive records lockable; *not* a separate top-level area) is distinct from
  **Vault** (secrets infrastructure) — *Records is not the friendly name for Vault.* Stable skeleton =
  `Overview · Memory · Chat · Settings`; everything else is personal/pinnable sections (owner's own:
  Projects pinned, Music folded into Interests). **Setup/Customize is structural and model-optional**
  ("Customize" inside Settings; "Customize Worlds" as a button elsewhere). Vocabulary: **Run** (not Job) ·
  **Output** (not Result) · **Services** stays · **Computer** (never "Node" in the UI) · "Worlds Agent" is the
  technical name, install language is human ("Connect this computer to Worlds"). Plain default theme:
  **dark-warm**, may carry a recognizable Worlds identity, but lore/companions/strongly-themed illustration
  belong to optional theme packs; **evolve the existing generic-theme work, no new lineage.** Theme boundary:
  themes restyle + add personality but never rename nav / move controls / relocate information / change
  required actions or accessibility semantics — switching themes must not require relearning Worlds.
  Governing principles: *customizable enough to become yours while accessible whether you have a lot or a
  little to give*; *customization must never cost low-capacity recoverability.* **Preserve ≠ promote**; the
  first release is **plain, not tiny.** Reason: the product language had sprawled across competing terms and
  earlier subtraction passes over-cut real spine (Overview, Setup, theme machinery); one approved contract
  aligns presentation without flattening the existing product. The round-table interview is the historical
  source; this entry + `docs/PRODUCT-LANGUAGE.md` are canonical.

## Network overlay — NetBird dropped; Headscale + Tailscale preferred

- **2026-09-21 — NetBird is dropped as the Node networking overlay; Headscale + Tailscale is the preferred
  fully-open alternative (human owner decision + research-desk pin).** Supersedes the "NetBird = preferred
  prototype" line in the Workbench & Node entry above; ADR-0005 rewritten accordingly. Trigger: the owner
  rule *"no core Worlds capability may depend on a paid/Enterprise-only feature."* Pin (2026-09-21, primary
  sources): NetBird self-hosted is **open-core** — a free Community Edition *plus* a **Commercial/Enterprise
  tier** gating advanced features (a 2026 trade article cites ~€2,000/yr "Commercial Starter"); NetBird also
  relicensed BSD-3 → **AGPLv3** (their announcement, 2025-08-04). That trips the no-paid-gate rule → out.
  Replacement: **Headscale** (`juanfont/headscale`, **BSD-3**) — the open-source self-hosted **Tailscale
  control server / coordinator**, acknowledged by Tailscale for single-tailnet self-hosting — + **Tailscale
  clients** (BSD-3). Architecture fit (owner intent): a **cloud VPS ("Worlds Edge") runs the Headscale
  coordinator** (+ optional self-hosted DERP relay + Caddy ingress), **managed through Worlds** via the
  `NetworkOverlay` → `HeadscaleAdapter` contract; any overlay stays replaceable behind it.
- **Tailcat** (`tailscale/tailcat`, **BSD-3**, open-sourced Aug 2026) is recorded as a **complementary
  point-to-point tool, not the coordinator**: "Tailscale without Tailscale" — netcat over WireGuard with
  **no control plane** (metadata exchanged out of band). Strong candidate for the lightweight remote
  **terminal / file-drop / port-forward** capabilities (ADR-0004). Caveat: **no API/CLI/wire stability
  promises** (young) → pin versions, avoid deep coupling.
- Scoped legal note: the "Tailscale + Headscale enterprise legal concern" is about **reselling a commercial
  service** on the protocol/brand, not personal self-hosted use (BSD-3, unrestricted). The first Workbench
  thin slice still uses **no overlay** (SSH + the existing `lab` CLI); Headscale is sequenced behind it.
  Reason: preserves the no-paid-gate + replaceable-adapter rules and the owner's "easy, fully open,
  coordinator-on-a-VPS-controlled-through-Worlds" intent.

## Frontend is Worlds; Station is a theme (navigation reframe)

- **2026-09-21 — "The frontend is Worlds. Station is a theme" (owner, human).** The **stable skeleton**
  (`Overview · Memory · Chat · Settings` + personal sections) is the real, deterministic navigation. The whole
  **star-map / constellation navigation model** (map-as-frontend, seven constellations, drill-through,
  companion orbs, "fly the map to reach a place") moves **out of the core** and into the **later Station theme
  package**. A person must never have to use a spatial map to find something — that was a theme assumption
  that had become load-bearing. **Supersedes master-handoff decision 11 ("Station map = the frontend",
  2026-09-16).**
  - **Station is kept, not deleted** — its palettes, art, companions, and map views remain selectable
    theme/experience packs. Rejected is Station as *default, baseline palette, or required vocabulary.*
  - **Default theme = a complete existing pack, not a hand-built shell.** "Plain" means the **structure**
    (calm, predictable, accessible, low cognitive load) — **not colorless.** Project Worlds ships a **full
    multi-color pack** (all `--pw-*` tokens; the existing set already passes `lab design theme validate`).
    Do **not** author a partial `plain.json` shell (that forces "all the other work" later). Reuse a full
    pack, or generate one via `lab design theme make` only if none feels like home. **The aubergine "station"
    pack is not the default.** **Starting-default pack = `starfield`** (owner, human, 2026-09-21) — a complete,
    validated full palette (deep-navy + warm amber + teal), functionally the amber+teal warm-dark direction,
    already full. Its provenance note "adapted from the constellation portfolio" is an internal lineage tag
    **only** — a *palette carries no lore / companion / star-map navigation*, so choosing it does not
    reintroduce Station; the constellation-*navigation* ban stands independently of palette. (Optional later:
    retitle the default to `Worlds` and neutralize the provenance line — cosmetic.) Other full packs
    (`ocean` / `moss` / `aurora-garden` / `copper-kitchen`) ship as switchable color options. Canonical
    language: `docs/PRODUCT-LANGUAGE.md`.
    Reason: earlier over-subtraction treated real spine as hypothetical and conflated *plain* with *colorless*
    and hand-built a shell; this corrects both and makes the frontend/navigation unambiguously Worlds, with
    Station as one theme among several.

## The rebuild is the shippable product (supersedes D6 "React parked for beta")

- **2026-09-21 — The `pw-vnext-station/ui/` React rebuild is promoted to *the* shippable product; the
  currently-served vanilla `/station/` is experimental and will be retired, not polished (owner, human).**
  Reverses the 2026-09-20 D6 framing ("plain Station centers v1; React spike PARKED as beta candidate —
  no energy until beta"). Reason (owner): "the settings never really worked right on the last one due to
  web inconsistencies… this should be cleaner… wire in the new stuff properly and that's our shippable
  product. current is still experimental after all." The rebuild already has the schema-driven Settings Room
  (prefs→DOM, motion firewall proven both directions, zero-error pipeline); the finicky surface is the one
  we were serving.
- **Definition of done for "shippable" (owner bar, in her words):** *"everything wired to* ***something***,
  and understandable."* Concretely — no floating/dangling piece; every control hits a real endpoint or an
  **honest empty/not-configured state**; no fabricated data or dead buttons; a newcomer (or Rylee on a low
  day) can read any screen and know what it does and where its data comes from. **usable > ceremony** — not
  "hit parity with the throwaway."
- **Consequences:**
  - The D14 big-bang flip gate was a *parity checklist against the served (now-experimental) surface*. With
    the rebuild as the product, that parity is no longer the bar — **re-aim it** to: "does the rebuild wire to
    real/honest endpoints and read as understandable?" Reuse the contract-triage CORE as a *coverage* map, not
    a *parity* jail.
  - **Rylee greenlights rebuilding the API interface if it serves wiring + understandability** — but API/contract
    changes are core-owned + Play-Nice governed with real blast radius (tests, `/api/manifest`, docs). Decide
    them deliberately (route-by-route as wiring demands), not as a speculative rewrite.
  - The genuinely-new *build* work is small and already named in STATE: give `ui/` a real **serve path** in the
    product image (the named flip gap) + fix the **npm peer-dep / storybook version-skew** tree break. Wire the
    rest to the existing backend (the "Lego box" stays; reads open, writes gated).
- **Honest state:** build/serve of the rebuild is **UNVERIFIED this session** — last-verified 2026-09-20
  (preview deployed on a fresh volume, gates green), *not* re-run today; first action is a live grounding pass,
  not assertion.

## Product Council Δ-record (C1–C12) — 2026-09-21, appended per the append-only rule

- **2026-09-21 — The two-week product council ran C1–C12 and changed the product record.
  Full minutes:** `WORLDS-PRODUCT-COUNCIL-2026-09-21.md`. **The plan it produced:**
  `WORLDS-DELIVERY-ORCHESTRATION-PLAN-2026-09-21.md` (supersedes
  `WORLDS-FRIEND-UAT-PLAN-2026-09-21.md` as the *live* delivery plan; the UAT-plan
  file remains as record of Phase-B lanes). Reason: earlier drafts front-loaded the
  friend gate; C2+C7 corrected the sequence to Phase A (Rylee's home, with L-WB)
  → Phase B (friend-safe trial, L12–L16) → Phase C (v2 personality themes on
  stable bones).
  - **C1 (Research Desk):** the only live fact base is `docs/repo/WIRING-READINESS.md`
    (SHA `60823ae`) + this session's read-only probe; earlier prose (STATE, the
    2026-09-16 master handoff) is *context*, not evidence. L16 real friends can
    fail the plan and that's the point; budget goodwill.
  - **C2:** the product's four human moments (Morning / Working / Stressed /
    Curious) are the acceptance frame.
  - **C3:** two new artifacts added as **gates** — the **landmark-stability rule**
    (four skeleton landmarks stay reachable under any customization/theme) and an
    **interruption/resumption fixture** on synthetic data.
  - **C4:** named the **blocking set** for Phase A (three frontend REDs + serve
    path / build repair), the **sequenced** set (registry convergence, chat wiring),
    and the **deferred** set (streaming, tool-calling, overlay/mesh/desktop).
    "Serve today" ≠ "the decided product" — L1 re-cut is required to make the
    frontend match the stable-skeleton contract.
  - **C5:** trust floor before any trial: vault step-up + true-loopback-only + per-instance
    isolation (lab-box multi-instance still shares host) + tear-down-after as an enforced
    lifecycle (not a promise). `vault.enc` portability is an open decision, not a default.
  - **C6:** two more gates added — a tested **degraded-mode state matrix**
    (model-off / provider-dead / node-offline / disk-full → each cell tested, no fake
    green) and a **timed restore drill** that actually brings identities + world +
    journal + vault (after the portability decision) + apps back on a clean box.
  - **C8 (Boring Council):** subtraction pass ran — no new storage/identity/secrets/
    network/CI/mesh enters the friend path. L-WB scope is **hard** (attach `ai-distrobox`,
    one host capability, one journal envelope); drift toward Podman-socket or full RMM
    re-convenes the Council. The `plain.json` shell stays deleted.
  - **C9:** Headscale (BSD-3) chosen over NetBird (AGPLv3 + Commercial tier). Two items
    recorded as **UNVERIFIED → to run** before their lane merges: a live build/serve pass,
    and NetBird's Community-vs-Enterprise split. `starfield`'s "constellation portfolio"
    line is internal provenance; the palette itself carries no lore.
  - **C10:** the **acceptance gates** are named (G-shape · G-real · G-safe · G-memory ·
    G-a11y · G-recover · G-degrade · G-workbench · G-onboard · G-trial) and they become
    the plan's definition of done.
  - **C11:** the friend-UAT (L16) is a consented research instrument with
    feedback→decision routing, *not* a rubber-stamp; the two friends are real people.
  - **C12 (synthesis):** the net product delta is the 4-verb record — **refined**
    (roadmap order: home→friend→v2) · **expanded** (four new gates: stability ·
    resumption · degraded-matrix · timed-restore) · **optimized** (lane split + reuse
    of existing machinery) · **shrunk** (`plain.json` deleted, streaming/mesh
    deferred to Phase C, Workbench is the *one* new capability in Phase A). The
    owner-decision queue at the end of the plan is the live to-do for Rylee.

  Reason: a two-week council should *change* the record. This entry is that change.

## Shared CI harness — 2026-09-21 (L-CI)

- **2026-09-21 — Pipeline plumbing becomes shared machinery; check semantics stay
  repo-owned.** Owner-approved ("I want every part of this to be really clean").
  New lane **L-CI** in `WORLDS-DELIVERY-ORCHESTRATION-PLAN-2026-09-21.md`: a
  private-first `ci-harness` repo exposing `workflow_call` templates
  (python-uv / node-vite / container-smoke) and the single action-SHA-pinning
  source; adopting repos keep a ~15-line contract workflow declaring *their*
  checks (public-safety, lore determinism, contrast-audit stay local concerns).
  Reason (evidence from the same-day estate recon): ~1,829 lines of hand-written
  workflow YAML across four repos with drifted action pins (`checkout@v4.2.2` in
  rylee_lore vs `@v7.0.1` elsewhere), uv-setup re-written per job, homelab
  validate.yml at 699 lines — copy-paste plumbing, not divergent requirements.
  Constraints: the word *harness* in play-nice-contracts already means the
  behavioral-research ledger — naming collision is explicit, README disambiguates;
  homelab and rylee_lore migrations are a later wave (pilot = personal-world via
  draft PR only, never lane-merged); validation requires a **real green GitHub
  run**, actionlint-clean is necessary-not-sufficient; `lab ci` wrapper only if
  it stays cheap. Doctrine applied: adopt the mechanics, own the semantics; keep
  machinery boring; one canonical owner per concern.

## Alpha/beta/RC definitions — 2026-09-22 (roundtable)

- **2026-09-22 — Release vocabulary fixed against the plan's gates** (owner asked
  the team where the project stands on the road to alpha; the roundtable ruled the
  question undefined until mapped, so): **alpha** = all ten G-gates green
  (shape · real · safe · memory · a11y · recover · degrade · workbench · onboard ·
  trial-launcher-safe) AND Rylee uses Worlds as her daily home for a week;
  **beta** = friend-hosted trial passed (G3, real humans + consent);
  **RC** = R6 owner taste-pass ("does this feel like mine?"). Current verified
  state at this entry: G-shape done (d3e6999, eyes-on via Steel browser);
  G-safe backend done (step-up/loopback/isolation, 1218 backend tests green);
  remainder ~35% with critical path Renai-art-fix → L4 → L7 → L-WB → L8 → L11 →
  owner daily-use week. Reason: a percentage without a defined yardstick is
  morale, not engineering. Simulated roundtable; owner authority intact.

## Correctness over preservation + the interface cutover — 2026-09-22

- **2026-09-22 — Owner doctrine adopted as governing rule**: correctness over
  preservation; broken work is deleted or replaced, not patched around; fail
  closed; evidence before completion; existing tests are evidence, not
  authority. Reason: three prior UI pushes each said "done" while the old
  interface kept shipping — completion claims measured artifacts (tests,
  commits), never the user-visible outcome.
- **2026-09-22 — The React rebuild IS the interface, published.** Owner
  directive: no side-by-side, no env-var gate, no localhost. `/` serves the
  rebuild from the container image (node stage builds ui/ → static/app);
  the retired vanilla Station and the frontend/ test suite are deleted from
  the tree (git history preserves them); /station and /vnext only redirect.
  The old suite's axe gate was PORTED, not dropped: axe runs on all four
  landmarks and found three real contrast failures (starfield/ocean/moss
  muted tokens) plus a Tailwind class-slot collision (`text-[var(--pw-…)]`
  compiling font-sizes as invalid colors app-wide) — all fixed; contrast
  audit grew 44→56 pairs to cover the blind spot. Evidence: backend 1325
  green; ui 168/168 + 67/67 e2e + lint 0/0; live container on :8000
  verified by curl AND screenshot. Supersedes the side-by-side policy in the
  2026-09-21 serve entry.

## Owner decision queue — items 1–9 resolved — 2026-09-22

- **2026-09-22 — The full owner decision queue from the delivery plan was
  walked one item at a time (human, Rylee; 9/9 answered).** Execution order
  agreed: record → workbench demo+merge → wizard pass (3+5) → compose volume
  (4) → docs sweep (6) → plain pack (2); items 8–9 deferred to their triggers.
  Nobody commits but the orchestrator; explicit paths only.

  - **Workbench spike (lane `workbench-spike`), three calls:**
    (1) **attach mechanism = (a)** — keep `run_task` synchronous argv-in/
    argv-out as built and tested for the demo; the (b) start-event /
    (c) TTY-attach choice is deferred to the broker contract's first clause
    (crossing the ADR-0006-4 durable/streams trigger knowingly, later).
    (2) **default allowlist = `ai-distrobox` only** on this machine;
    edits to `PW_WORKBENCH_CONTAINERS` / `allowed_containers` are
    step-up-class authorization config, never free UI input;
    per-container command allowlists are broker-contract material, absent
    today. (3) **envelope fit = spike's shape approved as-is** — 5 additive
    optional fields + `JournalKind.TASK` (flat, precedent-following), NOT a
    nested `TaskEnvelope`; `ExecutionViewer` stays its own executions view
    for now (store convergence = a later named call); `payload` keys stay
    minimal (artifacts/workdir/timing unfreeze = later). Merge of the spike
    branch is gated on the live demo being run first.
  - **D2 plain theme (draft `design/PLAIN-DEFAULT-THEME-DRAFT.md`),
    approved with one flip:** **accent = teal `#72B1B1` primary, amber
    `#D4A057` rare highlight** (supersedes the draft's "amber primary"
    proposal — the draft doc's Q1 answer is stale until updated by the
    implementing lane) · surfaces = warm charcoal (faint umber, as drafted)
    · headings keep **Young Serif** serif · **dark-warm only** for the first
    release (light-warm = Phase C) · on validation passing (`lab design
    theme validate`, fails:0 — proposed contrast values are NOT yet
    validated), **`design/themes/plain.json` becomes the first-release
    default pack; `starfield` demotes to a switchable optional pack.**
    **Supersedes** the 2026-09-21 "Starting-default pack = starfield" line
    above and the C8 "the `plain.json` shell stays deleted" note: the shell
    prohibition was against a *partial, colorless* plain — this is a full
    validated pack evolving the generic-theme work (no new lineage), per
    the product-language contract. Same a11y floor: luminance-only status,
    44px, focus ring, reduced-motion.
  - **Setup wizard behavior:** warnings **pause only when blocking** —
    a warning that means the next step genuinely won't work (SSO client-
    secret env var unset; existing `oidc.json` conflict) requires an
    explicit "continue anyway"; informational notes (search index build,
    "available after restart") keep flowing without pause. **No vault step
    in the wizard** — vault setup stays in Settings behind step-up; the
    `init.py` comment claiming "the wizard's richer bootstrap (token +
    vault)" is drift and gets corrected to match the code (token + stores +
    search index only).
  - **Compose config persistence:** the portable base gains a
    **`config-data:/config` named volume** (keeps the 2026-09-12
    "image-only, no host paths" rule intact — no bind mount in the base),
    so wizard-seeded `oidc.json` and `connections.json` survive container
    recreation instead of silently breaking SSO while `setup-complete`
    survives in `world-data`. The two misleading `compose.yaml` config
    comments ("Update config/connections.json", "Copy … oidc.example.json")
    are fixed in the same change; `docs/WORLDS-BACKUP.md` gains the
    in-container note for the new volume. Verification owed: write
    `oidc.json` → `compose down`/`up` → file survives.
  - **First-run naming:** `/setup` and `/login` say **"Worlds"** everywhere
    (title, brand, H1, finish button) — matches the approved
    `PRODUCT-LANGUAGE.md` voice; "Project Worlds" remains the formal name
    in docs/README only.
  - **L13 link collapse: proceed now, scoped as found** (the "owner pending
    doc commit" collision is moot — that work landed as `766d85d`/
    `b7e07fc`/`331b800`/`ab6dfda`). Collapse decorative cross-repo URLs to
    a single safe pointer and **collapse `STATUS.md` and `.agent/STATE.md`
    to one-line pointers** at `.project/CURRENT.md` in the same sweep.
    Security boundary holds: the collapse target carries no private
    topology. Gate: `tests/test_docs.py`.
  - **Five UAT tasks: confirmed as written** (WORLDS-FRIEND-UAT-PLAN §1:
    make it theirs via wizard · add something real · ask AI + model-off
    parity · find by browsing, deterministic · leave-and-come-back).
    No-coaching protocol and the per-task pass/fail/blocked evidence rule
    stand.
  - **Two friends for L16: deferred, not yet named** — re-ask trigger =
    **L14 clean-box passing** (nothing blocked; L16 gates behind L14
    anyway). Real humans, real consent, no rush.
  - **R6 taste-pass: deferred with a trigger** — re-ask when (1) the plain
    pack renders per the D2 calls above with contrast validated AND (2) the
    workbench demo has been run; then one sitting: "does this feel like
    mine?" R6 remains the only final gate before v1.0.
    - **Re-asked and GREEN-LIT 2026-09-22**: both triggers met (plain pack
      `e08ce5c` — `lab design theme validate` PASS fails:0, contrast-audit
      70/0, e2e 67/67 with axe contrast on; workbench demo run pre-merge,
      `472850f`). Owner: "start it now" — orchestrator prepares the eyes-on
      packet autonomously; the taste judgment itself stays the owner's one
      sitting (she is pinged only when there is something worth her eyes).
  Reason: these were the plan's standing owner queue — recorded here so
  every implementing lane cites written truth rather than a chat log.
  Supersessions called out inline per the append-only rule.
