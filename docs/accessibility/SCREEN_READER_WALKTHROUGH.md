# Worlds — Screen Reader Walkthrough

> **Status:** Current · **Verified:** 2026-09-26 · **Canonical for:** what a screen reader hears in the Worlds interface · **Read this if:** you use a screen reader, or you are changing labels, landmarks or focus in `ui/`.

**In short:** a walk through every screen as a screen reader announces it,
using the real labels from the code.

This walkthrough describes the current Worlds interface in `ui/` (the React
app that became the interface on 2026-09-22), at `main` `d9e9546` plus
"Ask about … in Chat" (#106) and "Find a room" (#107). It replaces the
walkthrough of the retired server-rendered dashboard.

Labels are **source labels**, read from the code, not a transcript of a manual
screen-reader session; announcement wording varies by browser and assistive
technology. The [Accessibility contract](ACCESSIBILITY_CONTRACT.md) remains
mandatory, and the Playwright suite (`cd ui && npx playwright test`: axe with
colour contrast on, keyboard, focus, reflow and reduced motion) is the
regression gate.

## Entry and landmarks

1. **Skip to main content** is the first focusable element and targets
   `#main-content`.
2. The **header** holds Sol's mark (decorative, hidden from assistive tech),
   the word **Worlds**, and navigation named **World navigation**. Inside it,
   the list **World landmarks** holds the stable skeleton (**Bridge**,
   **Memory**, **Chat**, **Settings**) and **Personal sections** holds the
   person's own sections (for example Interests, Projects). They are buttons;
   the current one carries `aria-current="page"`.
3. **main** is labelled with the page's name (**Bridge**, **Memory**,
   **Chat**, **Settings**, **Your crew**), and each page has one h1 (the
   Bridge's is visually hidden).
4. A **footer** status strip says the connection state in words ("Scanner
   online…").

Changing page swaps the main region; focus does not move to the new heading
automatically, so use the skip link or heading navigation after a change.

## Bridge (home)

Reading order follows the source: strip → first-day guide → lenses → star
map → needs panel → rooms.

- **Date strip**: date, local time, "since you were here", and the overall
  status in words (for example "1 system can't be reached", never a lone
  alarm word).
- **First day aboard** (a region named by its heading, "Welcome aboard, …"):
  spoken by the chosen companion ("Renai: …") or Worlds' plain voice. An
  ordered list of four lines; each says its state in words ("Done · 3 rooms
  connected", "4 of 6 answering", "Not yet"). **Put this away** hides it on
  this device; Settings brings it back. When everything is done, a region
  **You're all settled in.** appears once, then can be put away.
- **World lenses**: one button per system, each with its status word.
- **Star map** (region, visually hidden h2): each system is a button with a
  spoken label, never a URL. Artwork is decorative.
- **Needs you**: up to three items, then "and N more, quietly waiting".
- **Briefing panel**: the selected system's keeper line as text.

### Rooms

- A summary line in words ("1 room needs you · 2 quiet"). On a quiet day Sol
  rests beside it (decorative).
- **Doorway cards** (articles named by the room): "Needs you", the first need,
  "waiting since …", and the actions **Review "…" in a new tab**, **Open <room>
  in a new tab**, **Look inside <room>** and **Mark "…" as seen**.
- **Corridor** groups, each with its own heading: Also needs you · Unknown,
  unreachable or incompatible · Other rooms. Quiet rooms fold behind a button
  ("3 quiet rooms, all healthy · Show", `aria-expanded`).
- **Find a room** (12 or more rooms): a labelled search field. Its result is a
  status line tied to the field ("2 of 13 rooms below match "st"").
- Empty: "No rooms yet" with a **How rooms connect** disclosure.

### Room drawer

**Look inside <room>** opens a non-modal dialog named by the room, portalled
above the page. Focus moves to the room's heading; **Escape** closes it and
focus returns to the button that opened it (or to the Rooms heading if that
button is gone); the page behind stays usable. Sections, each with a heading:

- Needs you: each need with **Review "…"** and **Mark "…" as seen**. A
  Workshop approval also has **Approve or decline "…"**: a group named
  "Approve "…"?" opens with focus on **Not now**, then **Decline** and
  **Approve**. Sending says "Approving…" (status, static); only the room's
  receipt brings **Approved** (status, focused, under "Decided just now"). A
  refusal is an alert, "Nothing changed", with the room's reason and
  **Review again**.
- Changed since you last looked, then What <room> is showing, where the tone
  is a word: Good news · A small update · When you're ready.
- **Secrets** (Workshop only, the owner only): station health in words; asks
  from agents with **Enter <name> in Project Home, in a new tab**; key names in
  groups behind buttons with `aria-expanded`; what changed, in words. There is
  never a value field.
- Where this comes from, with **Technical detail** as a disclosure.
- Footer: **Open <room>** and **Ask about <room> in Chat**. The second opens
  Chat with an editable question in the message box; it is never sent for the
  person.

## Memory

h1 **Memory** with a one-line explanation, then the **journal** (write, draft
recovery with a conflict chooser that takes focus, and history) and
**records** (categories, matching records, and a record editor whose trigger
gets focus back when it closes).

## Chat

h1 **Chat**, the **Chat messages** log, the **Message input** textarea and
**Send message**. Errors are an alert with **Dismiss error**; a failed history
load offers **Retry loading conversation**. The chosen companion's picture is
decorative. A question from another screen arrives in the message box with
focus there, unsent.

## Settings and your crew

- h1 **Settings**, then the preference room, **Your crew** (with **Open your
  crew**), the first-day guide toggle, theme choice, and **Advanced** (the
  Vault tool). Toggle rows are real checkboxes with visible labels.
- **Your crew** (main labelled "Your crew"): the list of companions (each
  editable, hideable, and deletable if the person added it), a status line for
  saves and an alert for failures, **Your rooms** (a keeper select and a
  doorway select per room, named "Keeper for Studio", "Doorway for Studio"), and
  an "About your crew" complement (your companion, Sol, the rules). Portraits
  are decorative; names are always written.

## First Light (first-run setup)

A separate page before the app: six steps, each with its own heading (Welcome
to your World · Getting things ready · How will you sign in? · Make yourself
comfortable · Pick a companion, or don't · Welcome aboard). Progress is
static text and dots; errors are inline next to the control they concern.
Its structure is covered by `tests/test_setup_wizard.py`.

## Live regions and restraint

Status lines use `role="status"` (saves, search results, loading words) and
failures use `role="alert"`. Nothing announces on a timer: no poll, clock or
companion announcements. Contract section 8's cadence (meaningful events only,
about one announcement per 30 seconds, bursts batched) is a requirement, not
a proven property of every region; verify cadence with real assistive
technology.

## Still to verify manually

- Real screen-reader output (VoiceOver, NVDA) for the drawer, the Find a room
  status and the first-day guide.
- Route-change focus: the app does not move focus to the new h1; decide
  whether it should.
- Mobile sheets that trap focus and dangerous-action confirmations (contract
  sections 3 and 7) as they are added: they start on the safe action and say
  the consequence.
