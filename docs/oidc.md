# OIDC sign-in (provider-neutral SSO)

> **Status:** Reference · **Verified:** 2026-09-26 · **Canonical for:** OIDC/SSO wiring — config file, routes, flow, error codes, limits · **Read this if:** you want to sign in through your own identity provider (Authelia, Keycloak, Authentik, …).

**In short:** Worlds ships local token auth by default and can also sign people in through any conformant OIDC provider. This page is the operational truth for the wiring — the `oidc.json` config, the authorization-code + PKCE flow, the honest status states, and what is deliberately not implemented.

Worlds is self-hosted and universal: you point it at **your own**
identity provider.
[Authelia](https://www.authelia.com/) is the reference provider in the
wild, but nothing here is Authelia-specific — every endpoint is read from
the provider's own discovery document, so any conformant OIDC IdP works
(Keycloak, Authentik, Zitadel, Okta, Entra ID, a small `oauth2-proxy`,
…).

Code: [`src/personal_world/oidc.py`](../src/personal_world/oidc.py)
(discovery, PKCE, id_token verification) and
[`src/personal_world/auth_routes.py`](../src/personal_world/auth_routes.py)
(the HTTP flow). Architecture and the identity seam:
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#auth).

## When OIDC is absent

Nothing changes. Local bearer/session auth is the built-in default, and
`config/oidc.json` not existing is a healthy state reported as
`not_configured` — never an error, never a degraded world.

## Configuration

Copy [`config/oidc.example.json`](../config/oidc.example.json) into your
**private** config directory (`PW_CONFIG_DIR`, e.g. `config.local/`) as
`oidc.json`. The tracked example stays generic; your issuer is your
topology.

The file is deliberately comment-free: it is parsed as strict JSON by
every reader, and an extra key would make a reader that does not know it
drop the whole file silently. The annotated version:

```jsonc
{
  // The provider's issuer URL, exactly as it publishes it in
  // `iss` — base URL only, no path, no trailing slash.
  // Authelia: the URL users sign in at, e.g. https://auth.example.com.
  "issuer": "https://auth.example.com",

  // The client id you registered in the provider for this app.
  "client_id": "project-worlds",

  // The NAME of the environment variable that holds the client secret —
  // never the secret itself. Read at request time only; never written to
  // disk, logs, exports or API responses. Omit the key entirely for a
  // public client (PKCE-only), which Authelia also supports.
  "client_secret_env": "OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET",

  // Must include "openid". "profile" and "email" only add display
  // details; they are never authorization.
  "scopes": ["openid", "profile", "email"],

  // What the sign-in button says. Cosmetic.
  "display_name": "Home SSO"
}
```

Unknown keys are ignored with a warning; keys starting with `_` are
treated as documentation and skipped silently.

### Where the secret lives

Only in the environment, under the name `client_secret_env` gives:

```bash
export OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET='…'      # shell / systemd / compose env_file
```

- The value is read on each token exchange and never cached on an object.
- It is never logged. A provider error is surfaced as the provider's own
  `error` code, not as a dump of the request that carried the secret.
- It never appears in a redirect URL (front channel) — only in the
  back-channel token POST.
- `GET /api/auth/oidc/status` reports the variable **name** and a boolean
  `client_secret_present`. It never reports the value.

### Provider-side registration

Register this redirect URI with your IdP:

```
https://<your-worlds-host>/api/auth/oidc/callback
```

Authelia example (validated against Authelia 4.39; client policy
`one_factor` or `two_factor` as you prefer):

```yaml
identity_providers:
  oidc:
    clients:
      - client_id: project-worlds
        client_name: Worlds
        # Store only a PBKDF2 hash here; the plaintext lives in Project
        # Worlds' env. Generate it with:
        #   authelia crypto hash generate pbkdf2 --variant sha512 --password '<secret>'
        client_secret: "$pbkdf2-sha512$310000$…$…"
        authorization_policy: one_factor        # a passkey satisfies this
        require_pkce: true
        pkce_challenge_method: "S256"
        authorization_signed_response_alg: "RS256"
        id_token_signed_response_alg: "RS256"
        redirect_uris:
          - "https://<your-worlds-host>/api/auth/oidc/callback"
        scopes: ["openid", "profile", "email", "groups", "offline_access"]
        grant_types: ["authorization_code", "refresh_token"]
        response_types: ["code"]
        token_endpoint_auth_method: "client_secret_post"
        consent_mode: "implicit"
```

> **Passkey-first.** With Authelia's `webauthn.enable_passkey_login: true`,
> a registered passkey is the primary credential, so this client turns into
> a one-tap sign-in and the password is only the break-glass path. Project
> Worlds offers OIDC as the primary action on `/login` whenever
> `/api/auth/oidc/status` reports `configured`.
>
> `token_endpoint_auth_method` must match what Worlds negotiates
> from the provider's discovery document — it uses `client_secret_post`
> whenever the provider advertises it (Authelia does).

Behind a reverse proxy, the callback URI is derived from the request's
own base URL, so run uvicorn with `--proxy-headers` (or set the external
URL in your proxy) — otherwise the `redirect_uri` sent to the IdP will
not match the one you registered and the provider will refuse the login.

## The flow

Authorization code + PKCE (S256), no implicit flow, no token in a URL:

1. `GET /api/auth/oidc/login` → discover the provider's
   `authorization_endpoint`, then redirect there with `response_type=code`,
   `client_id`, `scope`, `redirect_uri`, `state`, `nonce`,
   `code_challenge` (S256).
2. The in-flight attempt (`state`, PKCE verifier, `nonce`, exact
   `redirect_uri`) is stored in a **signed HttpOnly `pw_oidc_state`
   cookie** — not in the database, and it expires in ten minutes. The
   signature key is per-process, so a restart honestly ends in-flight
   logins rather than trusting a stale cookie.
3. The person authenticates at the provider (their MFA, their policy —
   Worlds never sees a password).
4. `GET /api/auth/oidc/callback` → check `state` against the signed
   cookie → exchange the code with the PKCE verifier and client
   credentials → **verify the `id_token` signature against the provider's
   JWKS** → validate `iss`, `aud` (+`azp`), `exp`, `nbf`, `iat`, `nonce`,
   `sub` → hand the verified `sub` to
   [`identity.py`](../src/personal_world/identity.py).
5. `identity.py` maps the subject onto a local `Principal` and
   `auth.py` mints the ordinary `pw_session`. There is no second session
   model: an OIDC session and a local session are the same credential at
   the API boundary.

Identity mapping is deliberately conservative:

- **single mode** (default): the one person that install has. A verified
  external identity signs in as that owner.
- **multi mode**: the subject must already match an **existing enabled**
  local record. An unmapped IdP identity gets `403`
  (`oidc_identity_not_mapped`) — an external sign-in can never mint an
  account.

### Signature verification

RS256/RS384/RS512 verify with the standard library alone, so a minimal
install (`uv sync --extra test`) still has working SSO. With the
`cryptography` extra installed — the shipped container has it — PS*, ES*
and EdDSA also verify. An algorithm this install cannot verify is
**refused**, never accepted unverified; the honest reason is
`oidc_verification_unavailable` and the fix is `uv sync --extra crypto`.

No token is retained: the `id_token` and `access_token` are verified and
discarded. Sessions hold a principal id, not a credential.

## Routes

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/auth/oidc/status` | Honest state + discovery metadata, no secrets. Read-only. |
| `GET /api/auth/oidc/config` | Legacy alias of status, flattened for the login screen. |
| `GET /api/auth/oidc/login` | Start a sign-in (303 to the provider). |
| `GET /api/auth/oidc/callback` | Finish a sign-in (303 to `/` on success). |
| `GET /api/auth/oidc/logout` | End the local session, then the provider session. |
| `POST /api/auth/logout` | End the local session; returns `end_session_url` for OIDC sessions. |

`status` and `config` are unauthenticated by necessity — they are read
before anyone can sign in — and therefore bounded: the provider is fixed
by the operator's own config (never by a caller), and discovery results
are cached for 5 minutes (failures for 60 seconds) so an anonymous
visitor cannot turn the endpoint into a probe loop against your IdP.

### `GET /api/auth/oidc/status`

```jsonc
{
  "ok": true,
  "status": "configured",          // the four states below
  "warnings": [],                  // human-readable, actionable
  "data": {
    "status": "configured",
    "login_available": true,
    "issuer": "https://auth.example.com",
    "client_id": "project-worlds",
    "client_secret_env": "OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET",
    "client_secret_present": true,   // name + boolean, never the value
    "client_authentication": "client_secret_post",
    "scopes": ["openid", "profile", "email"],
    "display_name": "Home SSO",
    "pkce": "S256",
    "signature_verification": {"available": true, "backend": "cryptography",
                               "algorithms": ["RS256", "…"]},
    "discovery": { "authorization_endpoint": "…", "token_endpoint": "…",
                   "jwks_uri": "…", "end_session_endpoint": "…",
                   "scopes_supported": ["…"], "checked_at": 1760000000.0 }
  }
}
```

Four states, never blended optimistically:

| `status` | Meaning | Typical cause |
|---|---|---|
| `not_configured` | No `oidc.json`. Healthy default; local auth is the whole story. | Fresh install |
| `configured` | Settings parse, the provider answered discovery, and this install can verify what it advertises. `login_available: true`. | Working SSO |
| `unreachable` | Settings parse, the provider did not answer (DNS, TLS, timeout, 5xx). Config may be fine. | IdP down, wrong network, firewall |
| `misconfigured` | Settings unusable, discovery contradicts them, or the provider needs something this install lacks. Operator action required. | See below |

`misconfigured` covers, with a specific reason each time: invalid JSON;
missing `issuer`/`client_id`; `scopes` without `openid`; a non-absolute
issuer; a 404 discovery document (wrong issuer URL); a discovery
`issuer` that does not match the configured one; a missing required
endpoint; a required client secret whose env var is unset; and a
provider that only advertises signing algorithms this install cannot
verify.

`data.detail` carries the reason; `data.discovery_stale: true` marks
metadata that came from cache after a failed re-probe, so an old answer
is never mistaken for a live one.

### Failure presentation

Browser navigations degrade to `303 /login?pw_auth_error=<code>` (the SPA
presents it; the server does not render pages). API callers that send
`Accept: application/json` get `{"ok": false, "status", "error_code",
"detail"}` with an honest HTTP status. Codes are short and secret-free:
`oidc_not_configured`, `oidc_misconfigured`, `oidc_unreachable`,
`oidc_state_mismatch`, `oidc_state_invalid`, `oidc_attempt_expired`,
`oidc_missing_state`, `oidc_provider_denied`,
`oidc_token_exchange_failed`, `oidc_no_id_token`, `oidc_bad_signature`,
`oidc_key_not_found`, `oidc_alg_unsupported`,
`oidc_verification_unavailable`, `oidc_bad_issuer`, `oidc_bad_audience`,
`oidc_token_expired`, `oidc_bad_nonce`, `oidc_identity_not_mapped`.

## Logout

`GET /api/auth/oidc/logout` always invalidates the local session first,
then redirects to the provider's `end_session_endpoint` when it
advertises one (RP-initiated logout, with `post_logout_redirect_uri`).
If the provider is unreachable, or advertises no end-session endpoint,
you still get a logged-out local session and a redirect to `/login`.

Because no `id_token` is retained, no `id_token_hint` is sent; some
providers then ask the person to confirm the logout. That is the
deliberate trade for never storing a credential we do not need.

## Current limits (honest, not aspirational)

- **Step-up is unchanged.** An OIDC sign-in proves identity to the
  provider; it does **not** mint a step-up grant. `POST
  /api/auth/step-up` still requires re-presenting an application
  credential that resolves to the session's principal, so an OIDC-only
  browser session cannot elevate without the instance token. A fresh
  OIDC round-trip as step-up is not implemented.
- **No group/claim → scope mapping.** `groups` is requested only as a
  display hint; authorization stays entirely local.
- **No id_token encryption (JWE)**, no `x5c`-only JWKS keys.
- **One provider.** The config shape is a single client, not a list.
- **No automatic account provisioning** (by design; see identity
  mapping above).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | First thing to check |
|---|---|
| `not_configured` though you wrote the file | Is it in `PW_CONFIG_DIR`? Named exactly `oidc.json`? The file is re-read when it changes, but the *directory* is fixed at boot. |
| `unreachable` | Can the container resolve and reach the issuer? Try `curl -sS <issuer>/.well-known/openid-configuration` from the same host. |
| `misconfigured: no discovery document` | `issuer` must be the base URL with no path and no trailing slash. |
| `misconfigured: discovery issuer … does not match` | Your `issuer` differs from what the provider publishes (scheme, host, port, or a path prefix). Copy the provider's `iss` verbatim. |
| Provider says `redirect_uri` mismatch | Register `https://<host>/api/auth/oidc/callback`; behind a proxy, enable `--proxy-headers`. |
| `oidc_state_mismatch` / `oidc_missing_state` | Cookies blocked, or the login was started in another browser/profile, or the process restarted mid-login. Start again. |
| `oidc_bad_nonce` | Clock skew beyond two minutes, or a replayed id_token. Sync time. |
| `oidc_verification_unavailable` | `uv sync --extra crypto` (the container image already includes it). |
| `oidc_identity_not_mapped` (multi mode) | Create/enable the local user whose id matches the provider subject. |
