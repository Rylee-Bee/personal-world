# Ingress & TLS — serving Worlds over HTTPS (internal-only pattern)

> **Status:** Reference · **Verified:** 2026-09-26 · **Canonical for:** the reverse-proxy / forwarded-headers pattern for serving Worlds over HTTPS · **Read this if:** you are putting Worlds behind Traefik, nginx, or Caddy and need cookies and OIDC redirects to work.

**In short:** Worlds speaks plain HTTP on `:8000` behind your own TLS-terminating reverse proxy, and trusts `X-Forwarded-*` so session cookies and OIDC redirect URIs come out `https://`. This page is the sanitized pattern — substitute your own host and network values.

*Sanitized: no private hostnames or addresses live in this repo. Substitute your
own values where you see `<worlds-host>`, `<lan-ip>`, `<wildcard-domain>`.*

Worlds terminates TLS at your existing reverse proxy (Traefik, nginx,
Caddy — anything that sets `X-Forwarded-Proto`). The app itself speaks plain
HTTP on `:8000` inside your network and **trusts forwarded proto**, so:

- session cookies (`Secure`) persist correctly over HTTPS;
- OIDC `redirect_uri` is computed as `https://…`, matching your IdP registration;
- LAN clients use a normal hostname with no port in the URL.

## What the app needs (already in the image)
`uvicorn --proxy-headers --forwarded-allow-ips='*'` — set in the Dockerfile CMD.
Only enable this behind a proxy you control; it makes the app trust
`X-Forwarded-*` headers.

## Traefik pattern (file provider)
```yaml
routers:
  worlds:
    rule: "Host(`<worlds-host>`)"
    entryPoints: [websecure]
    middlewares: [secure]          # your existing header-hardening chain
    service: worlds
    tls:
      certResolver: letsencrypt    # or your internal CA / cert files
      domains:
        - main: "<wildcard-domain>"
          sans: ["<apex-domain>"]
services:
  worlds:
    loadBalancer:
      servers:
        - url: "http://<lan-ip>:8000"
```
Notes:
- Worlds brings its **own auth** (local session or OIDC). Do not put a
  forward-auth login chain in front of it unless you want double login; if you
  do, register the proxy URL as an OIDC redirect target too.
- With a wildcard DNS record pointing at the proxy, adding the router is the
  only change needed (no zone edit).
- Keep it **internal-only** by not publishing the entryPoint externally and/or
  firewalling the proxy port to your LAN.

## DNS
- Internal-only: an internal zone record (or split-horizon) for `<worlds-host>`
  pointing at the proxy's LAN address.
- Dynamic-DNS homes: a wildcard `*.<apex-domain>` A record at the proxy works
  and needs no per-service change.

## Verify
```bash
curl -sI https://<worlds-host>/healthz            # 200
curl -sI https://<worlds-host>/                   # 200 interface, or 303 -> /setup on first-run
curl -s  https://<worlds-host>/api/auth/oidc/status   # not_configured | configured
```
Then sign in once; the session cookie should persist across restarts (Secure +
HTTPS). If login bounces forever, the proxy is not sending `X-Forwarded-Proto`
— check `--proxy-headers` and the proxy's forwarded-headers config.

## Sanitization rule
Private hostnames, LAN addresses, and IdP URLs belong in your **private**
infra repo only. This repo ships the pattern with placeholders, and
`tests/test_public_safety.py` guards tracked config from private topology.
