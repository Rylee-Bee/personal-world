# Alpha status — Project Worlds (2026-09-17 snapshot)

> **Status:** Historical · **Verified:** 2026-09-26 · **Canonical for:** nothing (see [`.project/CURRENT.md`](../.project/CURRENT.md)) · **Read this if:** you want the dated 2026-09-17 alpha snapshot, not current truth · **Superseded by:** [`.project/PLAN.md`](../.project/PLAN.md) for direction and [`.project/CURRENT.md`](../.project/CURRENT.md) for state.

**In short:** a status snapshot of where the private alpha stood on
2026-09-17. Direction now lives in `.project/PLAN.md` (with
[`TRUE-NORTH.md`](TRUE-NORTH.md) for its honesty and accessibility
principles); this page is kept only as a record. Since it was written,
the interface flipped to the React rebuild in `ui/` (2026-09-22, Bridge
is now home), the server-rendered Station became a theme package, and
the rooms/registry/crew/doorways architecture landed.

## Where we are

The backend is daily-use capable and the Station is the product UI.

- **Backend — solid.** Auth/session/step-up, multi-user per-principal
  data, journal (+search), reminders, preferences, proposals
  write-safety (propose → approve → act), fail-closed vault, Git
  reads, one chat loop with provider-neutral adapters, generic OIDC,
  first-run setup wizard, `/api/manifest` (the Lego box).
- **Deployment — working.** Single compose appliance: core service +
  bundled Ollama + a one-shot `ollama-pull` (no API key needed);
  container daily-use proven.
- **Frontend — Station, honestly partial.** The Station
  (`/station/`, same-origin from `design/opendesign-exploration/station/`)
  is the product UI; `/login` and `/setup` are server-rendered. The
  real-data layer wires needs-you, journal, preferences, projects
  (source-control reads), and interests; chat send posts to the real
  /api/chat route (no streaming yet); the browser-local journal is
  labelled "Notes on this device" and remaining specimen blocks are
  plainly labelled and stay honest until real data exists.

## Honest gaps today

These are the verified ones; see [`ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md) for
detail and grounding:

- Chat streaming (the send path is real; responses still arrive whole).
- Remaining specimen panels (media cards, map region detail) need real
  data or honest empty states.
- Step-up authentication is a trust window, not re-authentication.
- Theme packs: registry exists, full front-of-house integration
  remains.
- Ingress rollups: implemented, not operationally verified.

## Needs you

Right now: nothing is blocked on you. Owner-scoped calls that sit
ahead of further work are collected in [`ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md)
— nothing there is guessable from repository truth alone.
