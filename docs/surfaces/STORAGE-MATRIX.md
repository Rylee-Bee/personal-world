# STORAGE MATRIX — Worlds

> **Status:** Reference · **Verified:** 2026-09-26 · **Canonical for:** the on-disk stores and what backs up · **Read this if:** you need to know where a piece of state lives and whether the backup covers it

**In short:** Every durable and derived store, its path, who reads and writes it, and whether the backup covers it. Rows added 2026-09-26 cover the rooms registry and per-person crew.

Paths are relative to `PW_DATA_DIR` (default `./data`) and
`PW_CONFIG_DIR` (default `./config`) unless absolute.

Notes:

- `backup_payload` includes world + journal only. vault.enc, users,
  sessions, apps, reminders, per-user trees, connections.local.json,
  theme packs, discovery.json, and reconciler desired state are NOT in
  any automated backup; recovery plans must cover them separately
  (matches ARCHITECTURE.md export contract).
- The **full-instance SOS archive** (`personal-world worlds backup`, format
  `pw-worlds-backup/1`) is the wider path: it covers world+journal, per-user
  trees, users/reminders/apps/proposals, oidc config (secret stripped),
  discovery, reconciler/lab desired state and theme packs, and `vault.enc` with
  `--include-vault`. See `docs/WORLDS-BACKUP.md`.
- All four export contracts (settings/world/story/backup) are
  serialization views, never the storage of record.
- `config/connections.json` is tracked and must stay secret-free;
  `tests/test_public_safety.py` is the regression gate.
