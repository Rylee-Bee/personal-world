## ISSUE RECONCILIATION

### Closed as already completed (were already CLOSED on GitHub)

| Issue | Title | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| #14 | Scheduler: background reminder runner | CLOSED — clarifying comment added about remaining notification delivery + missed-fire policy |
| #15 | Vault: secret-value retrieval path | CLOSED |
| #16 | Lab wrapper: mount/invoke lab CLI | CLOSED |
| #17 | Source-control: multi-repo discovery | CLOSED |
| #18 | Docs: OPERATIONS.md runbook | CLOSED |
| #37 | Workshop v3 remaining canonical frames | CLOSED |

### Closed this pass

| Issue | Title | Reason |
|-------|-------|--------|
| #39 | Figma remote MCP: OpenCode 403 | Closed as not planned — external limitation, supported workaround documented |

### Narrowed (comments added)

| Issue | Action |
|-------|--------|
| #14 | Clarifying comment: scheduler runner implemented, remaining work is notification delivery + missed-fire policy |
| #27 | Comment: propose → approve → act infra is real, remaining is extending to Lab/deployment/project/provider operations |
| #35 | Comment: now the next real UX milestone, reuse Connections & Providers as configuration foundation |
| #38 | Comment: check off completed 16/16 implementation tasks, keep only remaining workflow/companion decisions |

### Intentionally kept open

| Issue | Title | Reason |
|-------|-------|--------|
| #8 | Multi-user identity/SSO/permissions | Requires actual multi-user isolation, not just OIDC |
| #25 | Persistent personal deployment / beta | Real future milestone |
| #26 | Hermod Trusted Steward | Real future integration |
| #28 | Companion state / ambient presence | Real future work |
| #29 | Theme-pack system | Real future work |
| #30 | Quiet degradation | CLOSE after merge — now architectural contract |
| #31 | Progressive disclosure | CLOSE after merge — now built into product |
| #32 | Bounded contextual awareness | CLOSE after merge — now in brain architecture |
| #33 | Unified approval inbox | Real future work |
| #34 | Portable packages | Real future work |
| #36 | Accessibility contract | CLOSE after merge — now permanent project contract |
