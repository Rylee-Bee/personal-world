# CLI reference

Project Worlds has one CLI surface, bound to one source of truth.
Decision #19: *everything the product can do has a simple CLI wrapper
and an API route, and both derive from the same table* — so a small agent
or bot does not have to think, it just files things the right way.

The table is `src/personal_world/api_manifest.py`, the same one
`GET /api/manifest` serves as `endpoints`. Every wrapper declares the
manifest id(s) it files; its `kind`/`gate` are **read from that table**, never
restated. A binding check runs at import, so the map cannot silently drift.

## Three commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `personal-world api-manifest` | The bot's map: 110 curated endpoints, each with its gate and the shell command that files it, plus explicit coverage counts. |
| `personal-world api <METHOD> <path>` | The generic authenticated escape hatch against a running local backend. Any row of the map is callable. |
| `personal-world do <noun> <verb>` | The friendly wrappers — one verb per action. Bare `do` prints the table below. |

The pre-existing top-level verbs (`status`, `journal`, `prefs`, `manifest`,
`history`, `worlds`, `updates`, `framework`, …) are untouched. The new
surface is additive: a name `cli.py` already owns is skipped, never clobbered
(`manifest` is the legacy provider/capability manifest, and `tests/test_framework.py`
pins its exact shape).

## Coverage

- 34/110 curated rows have a friendly wrapper.
- 13 live rows are uncurated (reachable through `personal-world api`).
- The map reports this itself (`data.cli.coverage`); it does not imply completeness.

## Write safety

- Reads need nothing and change nothing.
- Writes file a **durable proposal** and exit `4` — nothing is mutated.
- To act, pass `--approve` **and** export `PW_STEP_UP_TOKEN=<instance token>`.
  A flag alone never mutates anything; a cemented policy still refuses.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | ok |
| `1` | error |
| `2` | usage |
| `3` | unavailable / not configured |
| `4` | gated: a proposal was filed, or approval/step-up is required (not an error) |
