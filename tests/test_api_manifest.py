"""The endpoint manifest — product decision #17: the API is the Lego box.

`GET /api/manifest` gained an additive `endpoints` key curated in
`api_manifest.py` and verified against the live route table. These tests
guard the properties that make it trustworthy to compose against:

* it never advertises a route that is not registered (no drift);
* the vocabulary stays closed — no invented gate or kind;
* a route the code gates with `require_step_up` is reported as `step-up`;
* a write is either gated or named, in the open, as not elevated;
* the existing capability manifest in `data` is untouched, so the SPA and
  the framework contract keep working;
* the payload carries no credential material and no filesystem path;
* the route stays authenticated.
