"""What's live: /healthz reports the commit the running build came from.

publish-image.yml passes the validated main SHA to the image build as
PW_COMMIT (the same SHA the org.opencontainers.image.revision label
carries); Project Home reads the short form off /healthz to compare the
live Worlds against main. The route is public and the repo is public, so
the commit is safe to expose — but only a hex SHA is ever echoed back,
and nothing else about the build leaks.
