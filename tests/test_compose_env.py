"""Production compose passes through every variable the production app reads.

The recurring trap (Rylee, 2026-10-08: "this block has caused lots of errors I've seen before"): compose hands the
container ONLY the names listed under `environment:`. A variable set in `/opt/personal-world/.env` that is not listed
there never reaches the app, and nothing complains; the feature just reads "not configured". Web Push shipped that
way: `PW_VAPID_*` were documented but never forwarded.

This test collects every `PW_*` name the front-door production app's code mentions and fails when one is neither
forwarded by `compose.yaml` (service `core`), nor set by the image (`ENV` in the Dockerfile), nor listed below with
the reason production does not need it.
