"""The manifest-bound CLI surface — owner decision #19.

Decision #19: *everything the product can do has a simple CLI wrapper and
an API route, and both derive from the same source, so a small agent or
bot does not have to think — it just files things the right way.*

The single source is ``api_manifest.py`` (the same table ``GET
/api/manifest`` serves as ``endpoints``). Every wrapper in this module
declares the manifest id(s) it files, and its ``kind``/``gate`` are READ
FROM THAT TABLE — never restated here. An id that does not exist fails at
import, loudly, the way ``api_manifest.Endpoint`` does. ``personal-world
api-manifest`` prints the joined table: every endpoint row carries the
shell command that files it (or ``null``), plus explicit coverage counts,
so the map states its own completeness instead of implying it.

Three commands are added to ``personal-world``:

* ``api-manifest`` — the bot's map (endpoints + CLI wrappers + coverage).
* ``api <METHOD> <path>`` — the generic authenticated escape hatch
  against a running local backend. Any row in the map is callable, so a
  capability with no friendly wrapper is still reachable.
* ``do <noun> <verb>`` — the friendly wrappers, one verb each.

``do`` is a group rather than bare top-level nouns because ``cli.py``
already owns ``status``, ``journal``, ``prefs``, ``manifest`` and
``history`` with pre-decision-#19 semantics that existing tests pin
(``tests/test_framework.py::test_core_only_cli_status_and_manifest``
asserts the exact shape of ``manifest``; ``tests/test_prefs.py::
TestCliPrefs`` asserts ``prefs set`` mutates immediately). This module is
additive and clobbers nothing. Retiring the legacy verbs onto this
surface is an owner decision, not a lane-local one.

Transports (both about what they need):

* ``service`` — the default. The wrapper calls the SAME canonical service
  function the API handler calls (``prefs.set_prefs``,
  ``Journal.supersede``, ``Scheduler.add``, ``NativeDiscovery``,
  ``ProposalStore``, ``TemplateRegistry``, ``OIDCService`` …). No HTTP
  server required, matching ``docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`` ("The CLI does not
  require an HTTP server").
* ``http`` — ``api`` and ``do chat send``. Chat's composition (world
  context, brain templates, tool loop, proposal extraction, transcript)
  lives only in ``api.py``'s handler; re-implementing it here is exactly
  the divergence decision #19 forbids, so those two go to the backend. An
  unreachable backend answers ``unavailable`` (exit 3) — never a guess,
  never a fabricated reply.

WRITE SAFETY (the part a bot must not have to think about):

* A write wrapper **files a durable proposal** by default and mutates
  nothing. It prints ``proposal_id`` and exits 4.
* Acting requires BOTH ``--approve`` and the step-up credential in the
  environment (``PW_STEP_UP_TOKEN``), which must resolve — through
  ``identity.resolve_principal``, the same single entry point the API uses — to
  the calling principal. A bare flag never mutates anything.
* Reads need no approval.
* ``--approve`` files the proposal first, then approves it through
  ``ProposalStore.approve`` (server-held evidence: actor, time, method)
  and executes it. The durable record survives either way, so there is
  always an audit of what was asked and what was done.

EXIT CODES (this module's contract; ``envelope.EXIT_OK``/``EXIT_ERROR``
are reused, the rest are defined here because ``envelope.EXIT_DENIED=2``
predates this surface and ``cli.py``'s legacy commands keep their own
mapping):

    0  ok — the command did what it says (``changed``/``data.mutated``
       say whether it mutated anything)
    1  error — refused, invalid state, not found, unexpected failure
    2  usage — bad arguments (argparse's own code for a usage error)
    3  not_configured / unavailable — nothing is wired, or the backend or
       a provider cannot be reached
    4  gated — nothing was mutated; a human must approve (a proposal was
       filed, or ``--approve``/the step-up credential is missing, or the
       surface is person-only). Exit 4 is NOT an error.

Every command prints the ``envelope.Result`` JSON with ``--json`` and a
short human rendering without it. Statuses are accurate, in the established
free-form style (``healthy``, ``not_configured``, ``unavailable``,
``proposed``, ``needs_approval``, ``needs_step_up``, ``denied``,
``person_only``, ``not_found``, ``invalid_args``, ``unsupported``,
``unhealthy``).

``ok`` and exit 4 together carry one distinction worth knowing:

* ``ok=true`` + exit 4 (``proposed``, ``needs_approval``) — the command
  did its DEFAULT job: it filed a proposal or showed the dry-run. Nothing
  was mutated (``data.mutated=false``); a human can approve it.
* ``ok=false`` + exit 4 (``needs_step_up``, ``person_only``, ``denied``) —
  the requested mutation was REFUSED. Nothing was mutated either.

KNOWN LIMITS (stated, not hidden — see ``docs/CLI-REFERENCE.md``):

* ``ProposalStore`` and ``Scheduler`` cache their JSON file in memory at
  construction. A backend that is ALREADY RUNNING will not see a proposal
  or reminder this CLI files until it restarts, and its own next write can
  drop it. This CLI always reads the file fresh, so its own view is
  correct. Closing the gap needs a create/reload route in
  ``api.py``/``tool_registry.py`` (out of this lane).
* ``cli.*`` proposal types are executed by this module's actor table.
  ``POST /api/proposals/{id}/execute`` answers ``unsupported`` for them,
  visibly, never silently.
* In-process writes make the CLI a second writer of ``world.json`` /
  ``reminders.json`` alongside a running backend (the documented
  multi-writer gap in ``docs/repo/WIRING-READINESS.md``). Write wrappers
  say so in ``warnings``.
