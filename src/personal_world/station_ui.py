"""Same-origin serving for the Project Worlds interface.

Owner decision, 2026-09-22: the React rebuild IS the interface. It is
served at ``/`` — the primary path — and there is exactly one. The
predecessor vanilla Station is retired: not mounted, not packaged, not
shipped. Old paths (``/station/*``, ``/vnext/*``) redirect to ``/`` so
bookmarks land on the product instead of a 404.

Serving it from this process — rather than a separate static host — is
what makes the browser session work: the ``pw_session`` cookie is
same-origin, so every ``fetch`` the UI makes carries credentials with no
CORS exception anywhere, and the API needs no browser-only token path.

Boundaries this module keeps:

* **Authorization reuses the canonical entry point.** Nothing here re-implements
  a credential check: ``api.require_auth`` decides, and this module only
  maps its verdict onto a browser-appropriate response (a redirect to
  ``/login``) instead of a JSON 401.
* **First-run wins.** Before the ``setup-complete`` marker exists, every
  interface path redirects to ``/setup``; a half-built world is never
  presented as a working one.
* **No user-controlled filesystem paths.** The served set is an allowlist
  built once at app start: a relative POSIX path → a resolved absolute
  ``Path``. Traversal cannot escape because it simply misses the dict.
  Newly added files are picked up on restart; edited files are re-read
  per request and revalidated by ETag.
* **Reserved namespaces stay 404, never HTML.** An unknown path under
  ``/api`` or ``/static`` answers JSON 404 like any unrouted API call —
  the SPA fallback never swallows a namespace it does not own.
* **Only web assets, never documentation.** ``.md`` files are excluded on
  purpose; ``_``-prefixed directories stay out entirely.
* **absence.** When the build is not staged, ``/`` says so plainly
  (503) with the operator's actual fix, and never echoes a filesystem
  path. The container image builds the UI itself, so a missing build
  means a broken image build, not a silent hole.
