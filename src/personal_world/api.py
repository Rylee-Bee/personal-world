    # PRODUCT-LANGUAGE §Records ≠ Vault. Records are user information
    # (medical, work history, identity documents, …), NOT secrets — they
    # never touch vault.py. They are stored as World Facts on the caller's
    # own world.json (the core's existing structured-state store; see
    # records.py for the full rationale) and audited through the caller's
    # own append-only journal, so per-principal isolation and the
    # supersession/owner-approval machinery are reused, not re-invented.
    #
    # Backing: Records are a Memory feature, so every route checks the SAME
    # memory-capability provider /api/memory/search checks, and degrades to
    # the identical honest "no memory provider" envelope when it is absent —
    # never a fake-empty success (capability-grid truth: off / no provider).
    #
    # Writes: gated with require_step_up — the repo's human-approval seam —
    # matching /api/world/fact and PUT /api/sections (the two closest
    # structured-state writers) and the journal supersede ACT. The elevation
    # is enforced server-side (_step_up_authorized), never from client trust;
    # agents are refused (person-only, like the journal/prefs surfaces).
