"""The endpoint manifest: one curated table, verified against live routes.

Product decision #17 (`docs/PRODUCT-VISION-HANDOFF.md`, round-2 answers)
makes the API a fully-exposed "Lego box": UI, agent templates and
settings compose against it, so a client needs a machine-readable answer
to "what can I call, and what does calling it cost me in
authorization?". This module is the single curated source for that
answer. `GET /api/manifest` serves it under the `endpoints` key; nothing
else duplicates the table.

Curation source: `docs/surfaces/UI-API-MATRIX.md` +
`docs/surfaces/MASTER-SURFACE-REGISTRY.md` + `docs/surfaces/AUTH-MATRIX.md`
semantics (ids, capability grouping, read/write, gate). Those documents
are prose and drift; the code does not. Every curated row is therefore
**verified against the live FastAPI route table at request time** and
carries `present: false` when the route it names is not registered, so
the manifest can never advertise an endpoint that does not exist.
Routes that exist but are not curated are reported under `uncurated`
with a gate derived from the code — completeness is stated, never
implied.

Vocabulary (deliberately small):

* `kind`: `read` | `write`.
* `gate`: `none` | `step-up` | `proposal` — the *elevation* required
  beyond authentication. `none` means "no elevation gate"; it never
  means "unauthenticated" (see `auth`).
* `auth`: `public` | `authenticated` — whether a credential is required
  at all. `authenticated` is the single `require_auth` entry point (bearer,
  browser session, or the opt-in loopback dev bypass).
* `present`: the route is registered in the running app.

Accuracy note on the enum: a few real writes (`POST /api/vault/set`,
`DELETE /api/vault/{name}`, `POST /api/chat`, `POST /api/setup`) are
gated by `require_auth` only — `docs/surfaces/AUTH-MATRIX.md` records
the Vault ones as a documented divergence from step-up. The three-value
`gate` enum cannot express "authenticated write without elevation", and
claiming `step-up` for them would be a fabrication that sends clients
chasing a grant they do not need. They keep `gate: "none"` and are
listed explicitly, by name, in `writes_without_elevation` — visible
rather than silently normalized. Credential-lifecycle rows (sign-in and
first-run bootstrap: capability `auth`/`setup`, or a `/api/auth/` or
`/api/setup` path) are excluded from that list because they mutate
session/marker state, not world state; they stay fully visible in
`endpoints`/`uncurated` with their real gate and `auth`.
