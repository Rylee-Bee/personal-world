"""DEV-ONLY Worlds server. Never production, never exposed, loopback only.

Run it with::

    python -m personal_world.worlds.dev [--host 127.0.0.1] [--port 8765]

What makes this a development tool and not a product:

* it starts the in-process **reference provider** and seeds a config directory
  that points at it, so there is something real to look at on first load;
* it uses a **fake principal** - every ``/api`` route resolves to ``dev-owner``
  with no authentication of any kind;
* it uses the **test-only sender** from
  :mod:`personal_world.worlds.reference_provider`, not the production outbound
  path, which is still the refusing stub in
  :mod:`personal_world.worlds.confinement`;
* the demo secret is a literal in this file.

The one guardrail that is real: :func:`assert_loopback` refuses to start on
anything but ``127.0.0.1`` or ``::1``. The comparison is exact - no DNS, no
name resolution, no "localhost", no empty host - because a check that resolves a
name can be pointed somewhere else than it claims. It runs at start-up only:
the bind host is decided once, and uvicorn is not reconfigured afterwards.
