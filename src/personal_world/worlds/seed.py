"""Seed config: a working example that exercises every state a card can show.

Contract: docs/rebuild/CONTRACTS.md (C1). The seed is ordinary C1 config -
providers, requests, cards and a home board - written through the same
:meth:`~personal_world.worlds.config_store.ConfigStore.save` the API uses, so it
gets the same validation, references and etags as anything the owner edits.

It points at a **reference provider** (an in-process loopback server, see
:mod:`personal_world.worlds.reference_provider`), which makes the home board
show the whole C2 vocabulary rather than a happy path only:

===============================  ==========================  =================
card                             what it proves             source_state
===============================  ==========================  =================
``reference-status``             status map + meter          healthy
``reference-items``              a list and a total          healthy
``reference-empty``              an empty list reads "none"  healthy
``reference-down``               the provider is failing     unavailable
``reference-bad-data``           the body is not JSON        degraded
``reference-locked``             a credential is missing     needs_attention
===============================  ==========================  =================

Every request is seeded with ``ttl_s: 0``: no caching, no last-good surprise,
each card render is a real fetch against the reference server. That is a
development convenience, not something to copy into a real config.

Idempotent: anything already present is left exactly as it is, so re-seeding an
existing config directory (or one the owner has edited) is safe. Only a secret
*name* (``env:REF_TOKEN``) is written - a secret value never enters a file.
