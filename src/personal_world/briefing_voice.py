"""Resident voice: deterministic, in-character one-line reports.

Pure functions: no I/O, no clock beyond the current UTC date, which is
used only to pick a stable variant so lines vary day to day but not per
refresh.

The full, curated line tables are in ``briefing_voice_lines.py`` (owned
separately). When that module is present its ``LINES`` /
``KEEPER_LINES`` are used; otherwise this module falls back to a minimal
built-in table of plain lines so a briefing never lacks a voice.

Accuracy minimum (outranks every voice rule, per docs/CHARACTER-HANDBOOK.md):
a line may only state a status and, where the table asks for one, a count
that came from a source. Nothing is invented; counts are the only numbers.
