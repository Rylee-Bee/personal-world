"""Worlds-owned room visit state — private, per principal, never sent to rooms.

The Room contract (``room/0``) is a front-door interface: a room knows
nothing about who is looking. This module is the *Worlds* half of that
seam — it remembers, for one principal, which room they last visited,
which needs they have already marked seen, and therefore what has
changed since. None of it is ever forwarded to a room, and it is stored
on the existing per-principal JSON seam
(``identity.principal_scoped_path``, kind ``rooms_visits``) with the
same atomic write every other Worlds state file uses — no new store,
no new format family.

The stored shape (one file per principal)::

    {
      "last_visit": {"room_id": "...", "title": null, "link": "...", "at": "..."},
      "rooms": {"<room_id>": {"last_visited_at": "...", "needs_seen": ["..."]}}
    }

Honesty rules:

* A never-visited room has ``last_visited_at: null`` and
  ``changed_since_visit: 0`` — never "everything changed".
* ``changed_since_visit`` counts a card only when its
  ``freshness.observed_at`` is strictly newer than the visit; an
  unparseable timestamp counts nothing (unknown stays unknown).
* A link is a same-origin path or it is rejected; the store never
  accepts a URL it might be tempted to follow later.
