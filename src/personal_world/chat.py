"""Chat capability: the chat-loop machinery over the live providers.

Architecture target (docs/DESIGN-HANDOFF.md, ROADMAP "Now"):
Personal World UI -> Chat API -> small context builder ->
provider-neutral ChatContract -> local model endpoint.

This module owns the provider-neutral loop pieces: message building
(system prompt + persona/templates + context), the ONE tool-calling
loop (``chat_with_tools_loop``), assistant-drafted proposal extraction,
and ``chat_once``. The provider classes themselves live in
``chat_registry`` (single implementation — the former orphan copies in
this module were removed, ORPH-03) and are re-exported here for
compatibility.

The local AI is optional and replaceable. With no provider configured
the capability reports ``not_configured`` and the core still boots;
the dashboard degrades to an honest "AI not connected" state rather
than a fake conversation.

Adapters in this module never log or persist secret material; keys
arrive through env indirection (the framework's secret rule). Chat
context is built from safe read APIs only -- the chat path can observe
the world but never mutates privileged state.
