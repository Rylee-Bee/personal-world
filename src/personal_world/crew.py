"""The crew registry — companions are user-owned (owner decision 2026-09-25).

The drawn crew ships as a **starter crew**, not as a fixed cast. A person
can add a companion, rename one, hide one, delete one they created, and a
room may have no companion at all. Sol stays the Worlds mark (the primary
logo) and is deliberately *not* a crew entry; Worlds is a place, not a
companion (owner canon 2026-09-25).

This is the Worlds half of the seam: private, per principal, never sent to
a room and never sent to a model. It rides the existing per-principal JSON
seam (``identity.principal_scoped_path``, kind ``crew``) with the same
atomic write every other Worlds state file uses — no new store, no new
format family. Portrait *bytes* are the one addition, and they are files
under the principal's own scoped data directory (a sibling of this state
file), written with the same atomic-replace pattern as the JSON. No new
storage system, no new dependency.

The stored shape (one file per principal)::

    {
      "crew": [
        {"id": "bolt", "name": "Bolt", "blurb": "...", "voice_label": null,
         "portrait_asset": "/assets/crew/512/bolt-portrait.webp",
         "full_body_asset": null, "source": "starter", "hidden": false}
      ],
      "keepers": {"workshop": "bolt"}
    }

Honesty rules:

* First read with no file (or an unreadable one) seeds the starter crew —
  the drawn crew — and nothing else. A stored file is authoritative: an
  emptied ``crew`` list stays empty, because the person meant it.
* ``keepers`` is seeded from the canon **only** for configured rooms whose
  id names a briefing system (``briefing.system_id_for_room_id``): Bolt
  keeps Workshop, Hekek the Engine room, Bruma the Archive, Mira the
  Observatory, Scoop the Newsstand, Ratatoskr the World tree — and only
  for a companion the roster actually has. A room id that matches nothing
  gets no keeper — never a guess.
* Once ``keepers`` exists in the file, it is authoritative: an explicit
  ``null`` (the person cleared the room) is never re-seeded.
* A keeper never changes a room's status. Status comes only from the room;
  this module only records who the person put there.
* Hiding a companion is a roster act, not an unassignment: the assignment
  is cleared by deleting the companion (the only thing the owner decision
  names as clearing it) or by clearing it from the room.

Portrait uploads (``image/png`` | ``image/jpeg`` | ``image/webp``) are
typed by **magic bytes**, never by the declared content type alone, capped
at :data:`PORTRAIT_MAX_BYTES` decoded, stored 0600, and served same-origin
with ``X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff``. They never travel to a room or a
model.
