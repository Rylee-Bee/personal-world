"""One way to open a URL in this package, and it only opens http(s).

``urllib.request.urlopen`` will happily open ``file://``, ``ftp://`` or
``data:`` — the scheme is what decides what a URL *is*. Every outbound call
here is built from an operator-supplied or config-supplied base URL, so a
base URL that is not pinned to http(s) turns a health probe into a local
file read (or worse, posts one somewhere it should never go).

``http_urlopen`` is that pin, in one place, so each call site does not have
to remember it. It delegates to ``urllib.request.urlopen`` at call time —
tests inject stubs by patching that attribute, and this keeps working.
