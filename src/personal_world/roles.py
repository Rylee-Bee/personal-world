"""Roles and permissions — the one place code asks "can this person do X?".

Direction (owner-approved 2026-09-26): roles are *bundles of
permissions*. Code never checks a role name; it asks
``can(principal, permission)``. That keeps one answer for every app
(Worlds, Project Home, Candy) and makes a new role a table entry, not a
grep.

This module is **pure**: no I/O, no env reads, no imports from the
package. It reasons only about the ``Principal`` it is handed (duck
typed: ``id``/``kind``/``owner_id``/``scopes``/``role``), so it can be
imported anywhere without a cycle and tested without a store.

Roles (a grant, not an account type)
------------------------------------

``owner`` · ``admin`` · ``member`` · ``supervised`` · ``guest``

``supervised`` is exactly ``member`` here: the narrowing (content
boundaries, no outside sharing) is *limits layered on the role* in
``people.py``, never a different permission set in this table.
``guest`` is ``see_shared`` only, and expires (``guest_until``).
**Agents are not a role**: an agent is a principal of
``kind == "agent"`` whose reach is the lesser of its token scopes and
its owner's permissions.

``helper`` is likewise a grant layered on any account, not a role; its
per-person ``see_needs_of`` / ``act_for`` permissions are answered by
``can(..., target=..., grants=...)`` from the live grants the caller
passes in. Those two names are never in a role bundle.

Group mapping
-------------

Authelia (or any OIDC provider) may assert ``groups``; ``PW_ROLE_GROUPS``
maps those group names to roles, e.g.
``admin=admin,users=member,kids=supervised,guests=guest``. The highest
privilege wins when several groups match. ``owner`` can never come from a
group — ownership is the install's, not the IdP's — so an entry naming
``owner`` is ignored and logged.
