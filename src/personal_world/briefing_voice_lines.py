"""Voice lines for the Worlds briefing (contract v1, slice 1b "first light").

Pure data: the residents' situation templates and the World Keeper's mood
lines.  No I/O, no logic.  ``briefing_voice.py`` selects one line per
resident/situation (stable hash of date + system, so lines vary day to day
but not per refresh) and formats the two allowed placeholders.

Voice sources (read and followed faithfully)
--------------------------------------------
* ``docs/CHARACTER-HANDBOOK.md`` — §3 Ratatoskr (quick, mischievous, finds
  paths), §4 Bolt (plain, careful, allergic to shortcuts; no pronouns), §5
  Burrito Journalism (warm newsroom; background before breaking), §6 Personal
  World (the spirit of the place; expresses through light, distance, what has
  settled and what is waiting), §7 Hekek (plain, steady, maintenance as care),
  §8 Bruma (soft-spoken, deliberate, provenance, gentle memory), §9 Mira
  (bright, curious, forgetful, follows the clue), §10 the two voices, §11
  attention voices (GOOD NEWS · A SMALL UPDATE · WHEN YOU'RE READY).
* ``docs/COMPANION-CANON.md`` §1–§2 — resident display names and server keys
  (``robot``→Bolt, ``hekek``, ``bruma``, ``mira``, ``taco-news-truck``→Burrito
  Journalism, ``world-tree-squirrel``→Ratatoskr, ``personal-world``→Personal
  World, the World Keeper).
* ``docs/CREW-AND-STATION-THESIS.md`` §3 — family rules: companions never
  carry critical information (semantic state lives in UI text, these lines are
  flavor on top), quiet is a valid rendered state, urgency is not movement.
* ``docs/PRODUCT-LANGUAGE.md`` principle 3 — "warm in tone, exact in facts":
  a failure is stated plainly, never softened into "looks fine".
* ``../media_files/MEDIA_INDEX.md`` character notes (read-only) — per-character
  voice lines and the pronoun canon (Bolt: use the name, no pronouns).

Honesty floor
-------------
Only ``{arrivals}`` and ``{have_tos}`` may carry numbers, and only in the
situations where they are meaningful.  No line invents a fact, a time, or an
age.  ``not_configured`` says nothing is plugged in here yet; ``unavailable``
says the source could not be reached; ``stale`` says plainly that what is here
is old.  No guilt, no urgency theatre, no shame for having been away; every
line reads fine whether the count is 1 or many.
