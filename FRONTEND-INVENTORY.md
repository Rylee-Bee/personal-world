# Worlds — Frontend Inventory

> **Status:** Current · **Verified:** 2026-10-02 · **Canonical for:** what the browser interface is and where each piece lives · **Read this if:** you are about to work on the UI and want the map before the code

**In short:** The interface is the front door, a small React app in `ui/src/fd/` (ADR-0008): four landmarks (Home · Connect · Memory · Settings), served same-origin at `/` by the backend and mounted by `ui/src/main.tsx`. The old screens, components and mock API were deleted; git history is the archive. Anything that names `src/screens`, `src/components` or `ui/e2e/` is describing the old interface.

## The stack

| Piece | What | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **The app** | React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind v4 (preflight only) | `ui/` |
| **Entry** | mounts `FdApp` inside the query and preferences providers | `ui/src/main.tsx` |
| **Front-door code** | everything the user sees | `ui/src/fd/` |
| **Styles** | one stylesheet: lab tokens (dark default, Daylight light set), shell, rows, strip, meters | `ui/src/fd/fd.css` |
| **Generated code** | tokens, icon sprite, API types (the build regenerates them) | `ui/src/generated/` |
| **Design tokens (truth)** | `design/tokens.json`, `design/themes/*.json` | → `ui/src/generated/tokens.{css,ts}` |
| **Worlds kit** | the framework-free design export other repos vendor | `ui/dist-kit/` (`npm run kit:build`, `kit:check`) |

## What is in `ui/src/fd/`

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `FdApp.tsx` | hash routing (`#home`, `#connect`, `#memory`, `#settings`; unknown or old ids fall back to Home), preference attributes on `<html>`, the Station decoration |
| `Shell.tsx`, `route.ts` | skip link, header / nav / main in fixed order; rail on desktop, bottom bar on phone |
| `Home.tsx` | greeting and briefing, whole-world strip, Edit Home, Needs you, Needs a look, Your life, Quietly working; independent loading; focus-hold |
| `Strip.tsx`, `Row.tsx`, `Meter.tsx` | the strip tiles, the instrument row with its drill-in, the seven meter types |
| `home-model.ts` | grouping rules (C6), briefing, greeting |
| `api.ts`, `safe-href.ts` | read hooks with per-request timeouts; link allow-list |
| `use-board-edit.ts`, `edit-model.ts` | Edit Home as C1 board writes (`PUT /api/config/board/{id}` with `If-Match`, 409 / 422 handling, Undo is another write) |
| `Connect.tsx`, `Memory.tsx`, `Settings.tsx`, `Tabs.tsx` | the other three landmarks and the shared tabs: Connect reads and writes providers, requests and cards, and lists actions and receipts read-only; Memory reads and writes kept, later and records; Settings holds preferences |
| `prefs.tsx`, `prefs-core.ts` | Words (Minimal / Short / Full), Density (Calm / Standard / Detailed), Station pack, theme, text size |
| `types.ts` | C1 / C2 / C6 types |
| `fixtures.ts`, `board-server.ts`, `msw.ts` | typed test fixtures (Home board and cards, Memory rows, Connect actions and receipts), an in-memory board server with the real rules, MSW handlers. **Tests only.** |

## API the UI uses

Home: `GET /api/boards/home`, `GET /api/needs-you`, `GET /api/cards/{id}`, `GET` and `PUT /api/config/board/{id}`. Connect: `GET /api/config/{kind}`, `GET` and `PUT /api/config/{kind}/{id}`, `POST /api/connect/try`, `POST /api/connect/preview`, `GET /api/actions`, `GET /api/receipts`. Memory: `GET` and `POST /api/memory/{table}`, `GET`, `PATCH` and `DELETE /api/memory/{table}/{id}`, `GET /api/memory/find`, `GET /api/memory/history`, `GET /api/memory/export/{table}`, `POST /api/memory/backup`. Shapes are in `docs/rebuild/CONTRACTS.md` (C2 envelope, C6 read API). `/api/pickup` is reserved; Pick up is omitted until it exists.

## Tests and commands (from `ui/`)

| Check | Command |
|---|---|
| Install | `npm ci` |
| Tokens | `npm run tokens:check` |
| Types | `npx tsc -b` |
| Lint | `npm run lint` |
| Unit | `npx vitest run` (files `src/test/**`; fd tests are `src/test/fd-*`) |
| Build | `npm run build` |
| Browser | `npx playwright test` — `e2e-fd/` against a mocked API and `e2e-fd-live/` against the real read API (`python -m personal_world.worlds.dev`); 390px and 1280px; axe with color-contrast on |
| Kit | `npm run kit:check`, `npm run kit:test:e2e` |

## Floors

Every UI change answers `docs/accessibility/ACCESSIBILITY_CONTRACT.md`: body 16px, labels at least 13px, 44px targets (56px strip tiles), a visible focus ring, no colour-only state (shape and word), motion off unless the device allows it, no horizontal overflow at 390px or 200% zoom. The manual screen-reader pass is a script, not yet a result: `docs/accessibility/FRONT-DOOR-SCREEN-READER-WALKTHROUGH.md`.

## Not here

Rooms, the Play-Nice contracts, shared CI workflows and the homelab live in other repos. The protected character art is not used by the front door; Station adds placeholder marks only.
